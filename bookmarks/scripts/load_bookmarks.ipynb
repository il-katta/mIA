This is important in our case because the previous price of a stock is crucial in predicting its future price.\\n\\ncomments\\n\\nBy Derrick Mwiti, Data Analyst\\n\\nEditor’s note: This tutorial illustrates how to get started forecasting time series with LSTM models. Stock market data is a great choice for this because it’s quite regular and widely available to everyone. Please don’t take this as financial advice or use it to make any trades of your own.\\n\\nIn this tutorial, we’ll build a Python deep learning model that will predict the future behavior of stock prices. We assume that the reader is familiar with the concepts of deep learning in Python, especially\\xa0Long Short-Term Memory.\\n\\nWhile predicting the actual price of a stock is an uphill climb, we can build a model that will predict whether the price will go up or down. The data and notebook used for this tutorial can be found\\xa0here. It’s important to note that there are always other factors that affect the prices of stocks, such as the political atmosphere and the\\xa0market. However, we won’t focus on those factors for this tutorial.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nLSTMs\\xa0are very powerful in sequence prediction problems because they’re able to store past information. This is important in our case because the previous price of a stock is crucial in predicting its future price.\\n\\nWe’ll kick of by importing\\xa0NumPy\\xa0for scientific computation,\\xa0Matplotlib\\xa0for plotting graphs, and\\xa0Pandas\\xa0to aide in loading and manipulating our datasets.\\n\\nLoading the\\xa0Dataset\\n\\nThe next step is to load in our training dataset and select the\\xa0Open\\xa0and\\xa0Highcolumns that we’ll use in our modeling.\\n\\nWe check the head of our dataset to give us a glimpse into the kind of dataset we’re working with.\\n\\nThe\\xa0Open\\xa0column is the starting price while the\\xa0Close\\xa0column is the final price of a stock on a particular trading day. The\\xa0High\\xa0and\\xa0Low\\xa0columns represent the highest and lowest prices for a certain day.\\n\\nFeature Scaling\\n\\nFrom previous experience with deep learning models,\\xa0we know that we have to scale our data for optimal performance. In our case, we’ll use\\xa0Scikit- Learn’s\\xa0MinMaxScaler\\xa0and scale our dataset to numbers between zero and one.\\n\\nCreating Data with Timesteps\\n\\nLSTMs expect our data to be in a specific format, usually a 3D array. We start by creating data in 60 timesteps and converting it into an array using NumPy. Next, we convert the data into a 3D dimension array with\\xa0X_train\\xa0samples, 60 timestamps, and one feature at each step.\\n\\nBuilding the\\xa0LSTM\\n\\nIn order to build the LSTM, we need to import a couple of modules from\\xa0Keras:\\n\\nSequential\\xa0for initializing the neural network\\n\\nDense\\xa0for adding a densely connected neural network layer\\n\\nLSTM\\xa0for adding the Long Short-Term Memory layer\\n\\nDropout\\xa0for adding dropout layers that prevent overfitting\\n\\nWe add the LSTM layer and later add a few\\xa0Dropout\\xa0layers to prevent overfitting. We add the LSTM layer with the following arguments:\\n\\n50 units\\xa0which is the dimensionality of the output space\\n\\nreturn_sequences=True\\xa0which determines whether to return the last output in the output sequence, or the full sequence\\n\\ninput_shape\\xa0as the shape of our training set.\\n\\nWhen defining the\\xa0Dropout\\xa0layers, we specify 0.2, meaning that 20% of the layers will be dropped. Thereafter, we add the\\xa0Dense\\xa0layer that specifies the output of 1 unit. After this, we compile our model using the popular adam optimizer and set the loss as the\\xa0mean_squarred_error. This will compute the mean of the squared errors. Next, we fit the model to run on 100 epochs with a batch size of 32. Keep in mind that, depending on the specs of your computer, this might take a few minutes to finish running.\\n\\nPredicting Future Stock using the Test\\xa0Set\\n\\nFirst we need to import the test set that we’ll use to make our predictions on.\\n\\nIn order to predict future stock prices we need to do a couple of things after loading in the test set:\\n\\nMerge the training set and the test set on the 0 axis.\\n\\nSet the time step as 60 (as seen previously)\\n\\nUse\\xa0MinMaxScaler\\xa0to transform the new dataset\\n\\nReshape the dataset as done previously\\n\\nAfter making the predictions we use\\xa0inverse_transform\\xa0to get back the stock prices in normal readable format.\\n\\nPlotting the\\xa0Results\\n\\nFinally, we use Matplotlib to visualize the result of the predicted stock price and the real stock price.\\n\\nFrom the plot we can see that the real stock price went up while our model also predicted that the price of the stock will go up. This clearly shows how powerful LSTMs are for analyzing time series and sequential data.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nmoving averages,\\n\\nlinear regression,\\n\\nK-Nearest Neighbours,\\n\\nARIMA\\xa0and\\n\\nProphet. These are techniques that one can test on their own and compare their performance with the Keras LSTM. If you wish to learn more about Keras and deep learning you can find my articles on that\\n\\nhere\\xa0and\\n\\nhere.\\n\\nDiscuss this post on\\xa0Reddit\\xa0and\\xa0Hacker News.\\n\\nBio: Derrick Mwiti is a data analyst, a writer, and a mentor.

Se impostiamo una password difficile rischiamo di far fallire un attacco brute force!\\n\\n[database_mysql]: parametri per loggare tutta l'attività di kippo su un db mysql. Di default questa opzione non è attiva.\\n\\nSu Linux per motivi di sicurezza kippo non può essere eseguita come root e quindi non può mettersi direttamente in ascolto sulle porte basse del sistema (< 1024) tra cui anche quella di default del server ssh (la porta 22).\\n\\nPer reindirizzare la porta 22 sulla porta in cui abbiamo messo in ascolto la honeypot dobbiamo impostare un reindirizzamento con il firewall di sistema. L'impostazione corretta dipende dal firewall che state usando sul vostro server e dalla tipologia della rete.\\n\\nAd esempio con iptables:\\n\\nCopy\\n\\nRiprodurre gli attacchi registrati da Kippo\\n\\nUna volta completati i passaggi precedenti non ci resta che mettere in esecuzione:\\n\\nKippo rimane in esecuzione in background e... aspetta che qualche attaccante si faccia vivo.\\n\\nQuando finalmente riusciremo a registrare un attacco (e solitamente è questione di solo poche ore!) l'honeypot si occuperà di registrare ogni movimento.\\n\\nNella cartella log/ verranno salvati i log interattivi delle sessioni registrate e in dl/ verranno salvati i file e gli eseguibili che gli ignari attaccanti tenteranno di scaricare sul server (di solito rootkit, malware generici, etc)\\n\\nIl divertimento, una volta collezionati un po di log interattivi, è quello di riprodurli con il playlog che è una utilità che permette di riprodurre i log come se fossero un video.\\n\\nIl programma si trova nella cartella utils/, per eseguirlo (da linea di comando):\\n\\nCopy\\n\\nUn esempio di log:\\n\\nVisualizzare i log può essere molto educativo ma altrettanto interessante può essere anche dare un'occhiata ai campione di malware che riusciamo a raccogliere (di solito è questo il princiaple motivo d'essere di una honeypot).\\n\\nPer ottenere più informazioni sui campioni raccolti è possibile cimentarsi in un'analisi manuale oppure utilizzare servizi online come VirusTotal.\\n\\nStatistiche\\n\\nQuando si ha una honeypot funzionante a pieno regime può risultare scomodo controllare periodicamente i log per capire il numero di attacchi ricevuti, la durata e altre informazioni utili.\\n\\nPer facilitarci le cose possiamo affidarci a un programma come Kippo Graph che si occupa di generare statistiche dettagliate e farci risparmiare del tempo prezioso.\\n\\nFigura 1. Kippo Graph\\n(clic per ingrandire)\\n\\nConclusioni\\n\\nIl mondo degli honeypot è vasto e affascinante.

More information available from the bot18.net website.\\n\\nBTW, This Is A Beta.\\n\\nKeep in mind this is the BETA RELEASE. I will be constantly adding/changing stuff. Expect things to be broken, unfinished, and inconsistent. Live trading is discouraged unless you\\'re just playing around with small amounts of currency, or really know what you\\'re doing.\\n\\nSoon I will develop a roadmap for Beta -> Stable progression, Beta testing rules/instructions, and community tools.\\n\\nWhen the project stabilizes, I will conduct a poll for all Beta testers. If the majority feel it\\'s ready for release, I will release the Stable version, end the Beta program, and raise the Unlock Code prices to $99.99 for Single-IP and $499.99 for Unlimited-IP. All Unlock Codes purchased during the Beta period will work with the Stable version, and forever after.\\n\\nPlease be patient and stay tuned!\\n\\nWe Are Online.\\n\\nBot18 is \"online\" software, designed to be invoked without installing. Cloning the repo will only take up space.\\nThe only pre-requisite is having Node.js >= 8.3.0 installed.\\n\\nJust open a terminal or cmd prompt and type:\\n\\nWelcome To ZalgoNet. NetSec Is Our Thing.\\n\\nIf running Bot18 for the first time, you\\'ll be asked to log into your ZalgoNet account (browser-based signup form is at bot18.net/register) or you can create a new account through the CLI.\\n\\nAll communications and local storage are safely encrypted using the latest:\\n\\nTLS for all client-server transmissions with bot18.net\\n\\nHMAC_SHA-256 for all signed code from bot18.net\\n\\nXSalsa20 + Poly1305 for secret key encrytion\\n\\nBCrypt for secure one-way password hashing\\n\\nUnlock Code Required.\\n\\nTo get the most out of Bot18, you\\'ll need an 8-digit Unlock Code, purchasable for $49.99 (for a limited time!) at bot18.net/beta. You can pay by credit card or crypto-currency, and the code never expires and grants you automatic code updates for the entire Bot18 product lifecycle.\\n\\nOr, you can try out Bot18 for free (enter \"guest\" as the ZalgoNet username or run with --channel trial), but you experience will be very sub-optimal. The \"trial\" engine distribution (also known as \"cripple mode\") is heavily DE-optimized (roughly 10x slower), does not support auto-trading strategies, and auto-quits after 15 minutes. If you like what you see, invest in an Unlock Code!\\n\\nFor full licensing details, see bot18.net/licensing.\\n\\nConfiguration\\n\\nCopy this example to \"bot18.config.js\" in the same folder where you run your npx bot18 command, to configure the bot. Make sure you chmod 0600 bot18.config.js to protect your configured API keys/passwords from exposure due to liberal filesystem permissions.\\n\\nYou can also specify a specific conf file with npx bot18 --conf <path-to-bot18.config.js>, and/or define an account-wide conf at ~/.bot18/config.js.\\n\\nBonus points if you have MongoDB installed! You can activate data streaming to Mongo by setting c.mongo.enabled=true in your conf file.\\n\\nBeta Features (So far)\\n\\nThe Beta engine build currently doesn\\'t do anything but print something to stdio:\\n\\nThe current ALPHA version (now being ported to the Beta platform) is an early proof-of-concept, and supports:\\n\\nMonitoring live trade streams from Bitfinex and Coinbase Pro simultaneously.\\n\\nSupports Coinbase Pro (formerly known as GDAX) live trading. Tracks your account balance and reports profit/loss when you trade.\\n\\nPress the \"l\" key to list available key commands. Supports executing manual trades when yellow \"M\" is displayed at the end of the console columns.\\n\\nEnter \"A\" (capitalized) to enable auto-trading (not available in trial mode)\\n\\nThe early auto-trading strategy is based on orderbook snapshot power-imbalance, and is highly experimental. Currently, the Beta\\'s auto-trading strategy is not recommended for serious trading.\\n\\nFollow Updates and Keep In Touch\\n\\nFor announcements and progress updates, follow @bot18_net on Twitter!\\n\\nTo support Bot18 development, Buy a shirt, hoodie or mug!\\n\\nFor inquiries, contact us through the bot18.net website.\\n\\nCheers and happy trading,\\n\\n@carlos8f, May 31st 2018\\n\\nSalty ID: 3t27msBTpN2Mn2LP68ZFLUUo3AN37aoGerUFPHdus9tFJg3hw7upmnY9c7nQ9fv1EFFF9nxiU9JzFSYPRAnx8Age\\n\\nAbout\\n\\nBot18 is a high-frequency cryptocurrency trading bot developed by Zenbot creator @carlos8f\\n\\nbot18.net/\\n\\nTopics\\n\\nnodejs\\n\\nfinance\\n\\nmachine-learning\\n\\ncryptography\\n\\nbitcoin\\n\\ntrading\\n\\nethereum\\n\\nhacking\\n\\nalgo\\n\\nforex\\n\\ncryptocurrency\\n\\nbtc\\n\\nhft\\n\\neth\\n\\narbitrage\\n\\nlitecoin\\n\\nether\\n\\nltc\\n\\nmarket-making\\n\\nResources\\n\\nReadme\\n\\nLicense\\n\\nView license\\n\\nActivity\\n\\nStars\\n\\n193\\n    stars\\n\\nWatchers\\n\\n39\\n    watching\\n\\nForks\\n\\n34\\n    forks\\n\\nReport repository\\n\\nReleases\\n\\n43\\n      tags\\n\\nPackages\\n      0\\n\\n\\n        No packages published \\n\\nContributors\\n      2\\n\\nGarethWright\\n          Gareth Wright\\n\\nDanielRuf\\n          Daniel Ruf\\n\\nLanguages\\n\\nHTML\\n          95.4%\\n\\nJavaScript\\n          4.3%\\n\\nCSS\\n          0.3%', metadata={'source': 'https://github.com/carlos8f/bot18'}),\n Document(page_content=\"404\\n\\nThere isn't a GitHub Pages site here.\\n\\nIf you're trying to publish one,\\n        read the full documentation\\n        to learn how to set up GitHub Pages\\n        for your repository, organization, or user account.\\n\\nGitHub Status —\\n\\n@githubstatus\", metadata={'source': 'http://coreh.github.io/nide/'}),\n Document(page_content='Non ho trovato niente....', metadata={'source': 'http://www.tomshw.it/cont/articolo/guida-ai-processori-le-scelte-di-novembre/34409/1.html'}),\n Document(page_content='Code\\n\\nArchive\\n\\nSkip to content\\n\\nSearch\\n\\nProjects\\n\\nSearch\\n\\nAbout\\n\\nProject\\n    \\n    \\n      Source\\n    \\n    \\n      Issues\\n    \\n    \\n      Wikis\\n    \\n    \\n      Downloads\\n\\nnamebench\\n\\nLoading...\\n\\nThe Google Code Archive requires JavaScript to be enabled in your browser.\\n\\nGoogle\\n\\nAbout Google\\n\\nPrivacy\\n\\nTerms', metadata={'source': 'https://code.google.com/p/namebench/'}),\n Document(page_content='Build Meteor apps with Ionic…\\n            \\n            No Angular required!\\n\\n\\uf233\\n                Created with Sketch.\\n                \\n                \\n                  \\n                    \\n                      \\n                    \\n                  \\n                \\n              \\n              View on Github\\n\\nMade by @nwientge\\n             Sponsored by Differential', metadata={'source': 'http://meteoric.github.io/'}),\n Document(page_content='Modern Technology to Build Web Applications in 2022\\n\\nFebruary 4, 2022March 30, 2022\\n\\nbulletproof693\\n\\nMany innovative technologies are available now for the development of web applications. It will be really difficult for web-app development companies to choose the one that satisfies their requirements. If you are in confusion about which technology to choose, there is a solution for it. All you have to do is choose a technology that suits the goal of your organization and will also be convenient to maintain.\\xa0 In this blog, you will find some of the technologies that will be on the top of the game in 2022.\\n\\nBlockchain Technology – This technology is a hot topic of discussion these days. Blockchain is an encrypted, decentralized storage system that saves information in blocks and is later joined as a chain. It is in this technology that digital currencies such as Bitcoin are based. By utilizing this technology, the process involved in developing the web application can be done quickly and without much effort, as it allows developers to utilize open-source systems for their tasks. Blockchain has also given a new income source for the people through crypto trading. Several people are active crypto traders, earning good profits. However, it is important to choose a safe and reliable trading platform for successful trading. Visit https://kryptoszene.de/trading-plattformen/ to find out the best trading platforms available.\\n\\nProgressive Web Apps (PWA) – This is a kind of application software that is developed using web technologies like HTML and JavaScript.\\xa0 Today, many web design service providers around the world have started offering these solutions to their clients.\\xa0 It comes with features like push notifications and also provides offline access to cached content.\\n\\nAccelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) – This technology was built with an aim to create fast-loading mobile web pages. It allows companies to save costs on user experience designs and attract users having an internet speed that is very slow. It enables small businesses to create websites that perform smoothly across mobile devices.\\n\\nInternet of Things (IoT) – It is an internet-enabled devices’ network and the data can be transferred without human intervention. In fact, this technology is one of the most powerful web development trends as it promotes continuous data transferring. It allows companies to speedily engage with customers and also helps in creating personalized customer experiences. IoT is capable of building advanced communication between various operational models and website layouts.\\n\\nPush Notifications – These are clickable pop-ups that emerge while browsing. This technology is used as a high-speed channel for businesses to convey information such as offers and news. In the years 2021, this technology has been widely adopted by many companies around the world.\\n\\nAPI-first Development – In the case of this technology, APIs (application programming interfaces) are treated as first-class citizens. This technology is user-focused and allows web developers to work in parallel. This in turn helps minimize the time and costs involved in developing a website. One of the biggest advantages of using this technology is that it lowers the risk of failure of a project.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe selection of the web application frameworks should be based on the requirements of the organization and the skills of the developers.', metadata={'source': 'https://bulletproofmeteor.com/'}),\n Document(page_content='Semplice\\ntutorial sulla gestione di interfacce grafiche con Swing di Java.\\n\\n(a\\ncura di Malaspina Maurizio mauxxx@libero.it)\\n\\nIntroduzione\\n\\nQuesto\\nmini tutorial è dedicato a tutti coloro che si affacciano per\\nla prima volta al linguaggio Java o che non hanno mai ancora avuto\\nnulla a che fare con le interfacce grafiche pur conoscendo il\\nlinguaggio in oggetto.\\n\\nCercherò\\ndi elencare i passi indispensabili per costruire GUI (Graphics User\\nInterface) utilizzando tutti gli elementi di Swing che fanno parte\\ndel package javax.swing premettendo che non si tratta dell\\'unico tool\\nesistente adatto allo scopo (si veda AWT : Abstract Windowing\\nToolkit), ma di un efficiente standard rilasciato da Sun,\\ncompletamente scritto in Java, in modo da assicurarne un perfetto\\nporting interpiattaforma.\\n\\nCreare\\nuna semplice finestra\\n\\nPer\\nutilizzare una classe Swing occorre importarla singolarmente\\n(istruzione import) oppure importare tutte le classi come segue :\\n\\nimport\\njavax.swing.*; // rende accessibili tutte le classi Swing\\n\\n(Poiché le classi\\nSwing ereditano delle proprietà dalle stesse superclassi di\\nAWT, quindi è possibile utilizzare contemporaneamente\\ncomponenti di AWT e Swing. E\\' comunque consigliato limitarsi all\\'uso\\ndi Swing.)\\n\\nIl primo passo consiste\\nnella creazione di una classe contenitore che rappresenta\\nl\\'interfaccia utente grafica sulla quale potranno essere posizionati\\ncomponenti interattivi come pulsanti, caselle di testo e tutto ciò\\nmesso a disposizione da tali classi.\\n\\nCi sono due oggetti\\nprincipali dai quali poter ereditare le funzionalità di\\ninterfaccia :\\n\\nla semplice finestra dalle funzionalità limitate : JWindow\\n\\nuna finestra con caratteristiche avanzate (quelle che di solito\\n\\tutilizziamo nei moderni S.O.) : Jframe\\n\\nUtilizzeremo\\nin questa trattazione soltanto la classe Jframe come superclasse\\ndalla quale erediteremo le caratteristiche volute nelle nostre GUI.\\n\\nVediamo\\nquali sono i passi essenziali per creare una semplice finestra di\\nbase sulla quale andremo a piazzare dei semplici componenti :\\n\\nRendere\\n\\tla nostra interfaccia una sottoclasse di Jframe\\n\\ninizializzarla\\n\\tinvocando un opportuno metodo costruttore\\n\\nimpostarne\\n\\tle dimensioni esprimendole in pixel\\n\\nassociare\\n\\tun evento alla chiusura della finestra\\n\\nvisualizzare\\n\\til frame!\\n\\nBeh...\\na volte vale molto più un vecchio sano codice che mille parole\\n:\\n\\nimport\\njavax.swing.*;\\n\\npublic\\nclass NostroFrame extends JFrame { // Creiamo una sottoclasse di\\nJframe\\n\\npublic\\nNostroFrame() { // definiamone un costruttore\\n\\nsuper(\"Titolo del\\nframe\");

abbiamo visto che i frame per contenere componenti hanno\\nbisogno di un oggetto di supporto, una sorta di gestore incapsulato\\ndetto pannello, all\\'interno del quale vengono inglobati i controlli\\ncome in una sorta di matrioska; similmente per gestire il layout\\nabbiamo bisogno di definire ed inglobare un gestore del layout che\\ncontenga i componenti da piazzare e che aggrapperemo al frame.\\n\\nIn questo mini tutorial dirò, solo per completezza, che\\nJava dispone di 5 layout che possono essere concatenati ed usati in\\nmaniera innestata limitandomi a spiegare solo l\\'iutilizzo di quello\\nche ritengo il più versatile ed adatto ai più comuni\\nscopi : il layout a griglia avanzata GridBagLayout.\\n\\nSi tratta in linea di principio di suddividere un pannello in una\\ngriglia (righe e colonne), le cui celle saranno in grado di ospitare\\ni componenti desiderati ; la peculiarità di questo metodo\\nconsiste nel fatto che un componente può occupare più\\ndi una cella della griglia (N.B. Una cella non può\\ncontenere più di un componente) , le proporzioni tra le\\ndimensioni di riga e di colonna possono essere differenti ed i\\ncomponenti possono assumere orientamenti diversi all\\'interno delle\\ncelle.\\n\\nBisogna prima di tutto stabilire il mappaggio delle celle\\nall\\'interno del pannello, la notazione è quella classica (N°\\ncolonna, n° riga) a partire dall\\'angolo in alto a sinistra della\\ngriglia :\\n\\n( 0 , 0\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t)\\n\\n(\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t1 , 0 )\\n\\n(\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t2 , 0 )\\n\\n(\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t0 , 1 )\\n\\n(\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t1 , 1 )\\n\\n(\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t2 , 1 )\\n\\n(\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t0 , 2 )\\n\\n(\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t1 , 2 )\\n\\n(\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t3 , 1 )\\n\\nOra bisognerà dividere il\\nprogetto del layout in 3 fasi :\\n\\nCreazione di un gestore di layout\\n\\t(classi GridBagLayout e GridBagConstrait)\\n\\nDefinizione dei vincoli di\\n\\tciascun componente\\n\\ncomunicare i vincoli al punto 2\\n\\tal gestore ed aggiungere quest\\'ultimo al contenitore\\n\\nLa calsse GridBagLayout è\\ncapace di istanziare il vero e proprio gestore di tutta la matrice ed\\nè proprio una sua istanza che verrà agganciata al\\nnostro panello, la classe GridBagConstrait invece si occupa di\\ndefinire le regole di layout inerenti alle singole celle ; essa si\\navvale di 6 variabili di tipo int :\\n\\ngridx : n° di colonna\\n\\tdella cella da riferire\\n\\ngridy : n° di riga\\n\\tdella cella da riferire\\n\\ngridwidth : n° di\\n\\tcolonne occupate dal componente (si considera sempre l\\'espansione\\n\\tdel componente verso destra)\\n\\ngridheight : n° di\\n\\trighe occupate dal componente ( si considera l\\'espansione del\\n\\tcomponente verso il basso)\\n\\nweightx : definisce le\\n\\tproporzioni delle colonne\\n\\nweighty : definisce le\\n\\tproporzioni delle righe\\n\\nI parametri dei punti 5 e 6 sono da\\nconsiderarsi dei pesi ponderati. Per comprendere il concetto occorre\\nrendersi conto che per fissare le ampiezze di una colonna basta\\nfissare l\\'ampiezza di una cella della colonna stessa e per fissare\\nl\\'altezza di una riga basta fissare l\\'altezza di una cella della riga\\nstessa, le altre celle si adatteranno espandendosi all\\'area\\ndisponibile restante.\\n\\nPer pesi ponderati intendo che se\\nabbiamo una griglia 2 x 2 e vogliamo che l\\'ampiezza della prima cella\\nsia il 30% dell\\'ampiezza della seconda, devo impostare weightx della\\ncella (0,0) a 30 e weightx della cella (1,0) a 100, gli stessi valori\\ndelle celle sottostanti relativi allo stesso campo weightx posso\\nlasciarli a 0 il che sta a significare che il layout per quella cella\\nè stato definito altrove (nel nostro caso sulle celle\\nsoprastanti).\\n\\nIn definitiva si fa una somma dei\\nparametri passati a tutte le celle di una riga o di una colonna e si\\napplicano delle proporzioni con l\\'unica eccezione che uno 0 non vuol\\ndire ampiezza o altezza nulla se in qualche altra parte ne è\\nstato definito il layout.\\n\\nUn trucchetto per scrivere velocemente\\ncodice può essere quello di fare in modo che le celle che\\ndefiniscono il layout abbiano la somma dei valori dei campi pari a\\n100, così basterà limitarsi a scrivere il valore\\npercentuale della larghezza dell\\'intero pannello o della sua altezza\\n; questo è il metodo che useremo negli esempi.\\n\\nSi potrebbe pensare inoltre di\\ninserire inizialmente solo pulsanti a posto dei componenti reali per\\nvia della loro semplicità gestionale e per la loro proprietà\\ndi riempire l\\'intera area ; in seguito si potranno sostituire\\nsemplicemente i componenti con quelli reali.\\n\\nRimangono da trattare solo due\\nattributi per avere una gestione soddisfacente di questo layout\\ndinamico e sono contenuti all\\'interno della classe GridBagConstraints\\n:\\n\\nlimit : definisce il tipo di\\n\\tespansione del componente all\\'interno della cella che può\\n\\tessere di 4 tipi\\n\\nGridBagConstraints.BOTH :\\n\\tespande in entrambe le direzioni (default)\\n\\nGridBagConstraints.NONE :\\n\\tnessuna espansione\\n\\nGridBagConstraints.HORIZONTAL\\n\\t: solo espansione orizzontale\\n\\nGridBagConstraints.VERTICAL\\n\\t: solo espansione verticale\\n\\nanchor : definisce l\\'orientazione del componente\\n\\tall\\'interno della cella , si hanno intuitivamente 8 costanti :\\n\\tGridBagConstraints.XYZdove al posto di XYZ sono possibili i\\n\\tseguenti : NORTH , NORTHEAST, EAST, SOUTHEAST, SOUTH, SOUTHWEST,\\n\\tWEST, NORTHWEST.\\n\\nPenso che a questo punto solo un bel\\nsorgente ci potrà illuminare riguardo questi meccanismi :\\n\\n/***********************************************************************************************************/\\n\\n/* GESTIONE DI UN\\nLAYOUT A GRIGLIA AVANZATA MEDIANTE USO DI SWING

provare a gestire un layout differente!\\n\\nAbbiamo\\nnotato che ora la nostra GUI è a prova di ridimensionamento ma\\nnon è il massimo dell\\'interattività, infatti cliccando\\nsul pulsante non succede nulla.\\n\\nDobbiamo\\nimparare ad utilizzare i componenti visualizzati ed è per\\nquesto che bisogna parlare di eventi :\\n\\nGestione\\ndegli eventi\\n\\nTutto ciò che accade nella nostra interfaccia è\\ninterpretato come un evento, dobbiamo imparare a gestire e\\nclassificare gli eventi, utilizzando una serie di classi dette\\nascoltatori di eventi. Per utilizzarle, in Java 2, è\\nnecessario implementare un\\'interfaccia ascoltatore di eventi, tenendo\\npresente che quando una classe implementa un\\'interfaccia deve\\noccuparsi di definirne tutti i metodi.\\n\\nImportando il package java.awt.event (import java.awt.event.*\\n) si rendono disponibili i seguenti ascoltatori di metodi :\\n\\nActionListener : eventi di azione che sono provocati\\n\\tdall\\'utente che agisce su un componente (click su un pulsante) ;\\n\\tvale per gli oggetti istanza delle classi Jbutton, JcheckBox,\\n\\tJcomboBox, JtextField, JRadioButton.\\n\\nAdjustmentListener : eventi di modifica generati dalla\\n\\tmodifica apportata ad un componente (barre di scorrimento) ; vale\\n\\tquindi per istanze della classe JscrollBar\\n\\nFocusListener : eventi di selezione, generati da un\\n\\tcomponente che guadagna o perde la selezione ; vale per tutti i\\n\\tcomponenti di Swing\\n\\nItemListener : eventi di elemento, si generano quando\\n\\tun componente viene modificato ; interessa le classi Jbutton,\\n\\tJcheckBox, JcomboBox, JradioButton.\\n\\nKeyListener : eventi della tastiera, generati\\n\\tdall\\'immissione di testo da parte dell\\'utente ; interessa tutti i\\n\\tcomponenti Swing.\\n\\nMouseListener : eventi del mouse, generati dal\\n\\tpassaggio del puntatore del mouse su un\\'area del componente, o da un\\n\\tclick su di essa ; interessano tutte le classi Swing.\\n\\nMouseMotionListener : eventi di movimento del mouse,\\n\\ttengono traccia del movimento del puntatore del mouse sopra un\\n\\tcomponente e come sopra interessano tutte le classi Swing.\\n\\nWindowListener : eventi di finestra, ci avvertono\\n\\triguardo lo stato della finestra che contiene la nostra applicazione\\n\\tad esempio quando si cerca di chiudere, ridimensionare o ridurre ad\\n\\ticona una finestra, interessano le classi di tipo Jwindow e Jframe.\\n\\nPer usare tali ascoltatori di eventi è\\nnecessario creare un componente, creare un ascoltatore di eventi ed\\nassociarglielo prima di impostare le altre proprietà del\\ncomponente ed infine includerlo in un pannello ; si noti che la\\ncronologia di tale sequenza è determinante ai fini della\\ncorretta implementazione.\\n\\nSegue la lista dei metodi che sono\\nimplementati nelle classi dei componenti che li possono utilizzare\\n(in base alla lista sopra) nello stesso ordine della lista dei\\ngestori di evento :\\n\\naddActionListener();\\n\\naddAdjustementListener();\\n\\naddFocusListener();\\n\\naddItemListener();\\n\\naddKeyListener();\\n\\naddMouseListener();\\n\\naddMouseMotionListener();\\n\\naddWindowListener();\\n\\necco come associare un ascoltatore di\\neventi di tipo ActionListener ad un pulsante :\\n\\nJbutton pulsante =\\nnew Jbutton(“Pulsante attivo”);\\n\\npulsante.addActionListener(this);\\n\\nsi noti che tutti i metodi che\\nistanziano un ascoltatore di eventi richiedono un oggetto come\\nparametro, tale oggetto deve essere un\\'istanza di una classe che\\nimplementi una corretta interfaccia ascoltatore, in questo caso la\\nnostra classe dato che gestiremo dal suo interno gli eventi andandoci\\na definire i metodi dell\\'interfaccia che verranno richiamati ed\\neseguiti automaticamente in seguito al verificarsi di ogni evento\\npredisposto per essere gestito (di cui abbiamo istanziato un\\'oggetto\\nascoltatore di eventi all\\'interno di almeno un componente della\\nnostra interfaccia utente).\\n\\nVediamo ora come utilizzare gli\\nascoltatori di eventi nel caso di “eventi di azione”.\\n\\nSe nella GUI sono presenti più\\ndi un componente reso interattivo, dobbiamo occuparci del\\nriconoscimento di quale di essi ha generato l\\'evento prima di\\nintraprendere un\\'azione, ad esempio se abbiamo due pulsanti ai quali\\ncorrispondono due diversi comandi, ci si deve incaricare di\\nintercettare quale sia stato il pulsante premuto e richiamare la\\nrelativa routine associata ; a tale scopo ci viene incontro il metodo\\ngetSource(), che ci rilvelerà informazioni riguardo la\\nnatura del componente che ha segnalato di essere gestito.\\n\\nTale metodo dovrà essere\\ninvocato dall\\'oggetto che viebe automaticamente passato come\\nparametro alla/e funzione/i dell\\'interfaccia che dobbiamo\\nimplementare (di tipo EventObject).\\n\\nL\\'interfaccia actionListener ha un\\nsolo evento : actionPerformed(), quindi dovremo implementare\\nsolo il suo codice.\\n\\nEsempio di due pulsanti :\\n\\npublic void\\nactionPerformed(ActionEvent evt){\\n\\n//\\ngestiamo l\\'evento\\n\\nObject\\nsrc = evt.getSource();     // individuiamo il mittente della\\nsegnalazione\\n\\nif (src\\n== pulsante1) funzionePulsante1();  // scegliamo il giusto gestore\\ndell\\'evento\\n\\nelse if\\n(src == pulsante2) funzionePulsante2();\\n\\nSe ad esempio abbiamo due componenti di diversa natura, ad esempio\\nun pulsante ed un campo di testo che sono entrambi in grado di\\ngenerare un evento “in azione”, il seguente codice può\\nesserci utile ad intercettare il mittente della segnalazione :\\n\\npublic void\\nactionPerformed(ActionEvent evt){\\n\\n//\\ngestiamo l\\'evento\\n\\nObject\\nsrc = evt.getSource();     // individuiamo il mittente della\\nsegnalazione\\n\\nif (src\\nistanceof JtextField) funzioneCampoDiTesto();  // scegliamo il giusto\\ngestore dell\\'evento\\n\\nelse if\\n(src istance of JButton) funzionePulsante();\\n\\nUn ulteriore modo di intercettare il segnalante è quello di\\nutilizzare il metodo getActionCommand() che ritorna\\ninformazioni riguardo il componenente, informazioni sotto forma di\\nstringa che possono essere impostate con setActionCommand(String)\\n. Tale metodo risulta eccezionalmente utilie nel caso più di\\nun componente deve effettuare la stessa funzione.\\n\\nPer quanto riguarda gli eventi di selezione (focus) che si\\nmanifestano quando un componente ottiene o perde lo stato di elemento\\nattivo, gli unici metodi che occorre implementare sono :\\n\\npublic void focusGained(FocusEvent evt) e public void\\nfocusLost(FocusEvent evt) e\\ngestire il tutto come visto sopra.\\n\\nGlie venti di elemento devono essere\\nimplementati sviluppando il metodo void itemStateChanged(ItemEvent\\nevt) e per determinare l\\'oggetto che lo ha invocato occorre\\ninvocare getItem() sull\\'oggetto ItemEvent ; si può\\nanche controllare se l\\'elemento è stato selezionato o\\ndeselezionato richiamando getStateChange() che ritorna due\\ncostanti : ItemEvent.DESELECTED o ItemEvent.SELECTED.\\n\\nGli eventi della tastiera vanno\\ngestiti implementando le seguenti :\\n\\npublic void keyPressed(KeyEvent evt)\\n\\npublic void KeyReleased(KeyEvent evt)\\n\\npublic void KeyTyped(KeyEvent evt)\\n\\nil metodo getKeyChar()\\ndell\\'oggetto KeyEvent restituisce il codice del carattere del tasto\\nassociato all\\'evento e se non eseste un carattere UNICODE da\\nassociargli, ritorna la costante KeyEvent.CHAR_UNDEFINED.\\n\\nPer quanto riguarda gli eventi del\\nmouse, che sono generati da componenti che interagiscono col\\npuntatore del mouse, occorre gestire i seguenti metodi :\\n\\nmouseClicked(MouseEvent);\\n\\nmouseEntered(MouseEvent);\\n\\nmouseExited(MouseEvent);\\n\\nmousePressed(MouseEvent);\\n\\nmouseReleased(MouseEvent);\\n\\nogniuno del\\ntipo public void.\\n\\nAssociate alla classe Mouse Event le\\nseguenti funzioni : getClickCount() che ritorna il n° di\\nclick effettuati su un componente, getPoint() che ritorna le\\ncoordinate, a mezzo di un oggetto di tipo Point, del componente sopra\\nil quale è stato effettuato il click del mouse, getX() e\\ngetY() che restituiscono le rispettive posizioni.\\n\\nSe si vuole intercettare il passaggio\\ndel puntatore del mouse sopra un componente ci si deve servire\\ndell\\'interfaccia MouseMotionListener che implementa i seguenti metodi\\n: mouseDragged(MouseEvent evt) e mouseMoved(MouseEvent evt)\\n; con gli argomenti di tali funzioni è possibile richiamare i\\nmetodi sopra detti.\\n\\nPer gestire gli eventi di finestra che\\nsi manifestano quando un utente apre o chiude una JWindow o un\\nJframe, si devono utilizzare i seguenti metodi :\\n\\nwindowActivated(WindowEvent)\\n\\nwindowClosed(WindowEvent)   // dopo che la finestra è\\nstata chiusa\\n\\nwindowClosing(WindowEvent)  // al momento di chiusura della\\nfinestra\\n\\nwindowDeactivated(WindowEvent)\\n\\nwindowDeiconified(WindowEvent)\\n\\nwindowIconified(WindowEvent)\\n\\nwindowOpened(WindowEvent)\\n\\nad esempio con windowClosing si può\\nimpedire la chiusura di una finestra.\\n\\nAnche la classe WindowAdapter\\nimplementa l\\'interfaccia windowListener, infatti ci si può\\nanche servire di essa per chiudere una finestra :\\n\\nimport\\njava.io.event.*;\\n\\npublic void\\nChiudiApplicazione extends WindowAdapter {\\n\\npublic\\nvoid windowClosing(WindowEvent evt) {\\n\\nSystem.exit(0);\\n\\ne nella classe che usa il frame occorre istanziare un oggetto del\\ntipo ChiudiApplicazione e scrivere addWindowListener(nome_oggetto).\\n\\nNon tratterò gli eventi di modifica perché\\nriguardano solo le barre di scorrimento.\\n\\nNon resta ora che mettere in pratica le informazioni fornite,\\nprovando ad esempio a generare una finestra con due bottoni attivi\\nche cambiano il contenuto di un\\'etichetta, oppure rendere funzionale\\nl\\'interfaccia per la connessione presentata come esempio.\\n\\nSpero di esservi stato di aiuto o, almeno, di aver gettato le basi\\nper la progettazione di una GUI.\\n\\nRitengo comunque utile, ai fini di comprensione delle tecniche\\nOOP, l\\'utilizzo di Swing.\\n\\nPer qualsiasi tipo di commento potete contattarmi all\\'e-mail in\\ncima all\\'ipertesto.\\n\\nBuon lavoro.\\n\\nMaux', metadata={'source': 'http://www-lia.deis.unibo.it/Courses/RetiDiCalcolatori/contrstud/Malaspina/index.html'}),\n Document(page_content='Docs Home\\n\\n\\n\\nList\\n\\nSections\\n\\nTiles\\n\\nSearch Results\\n\\nresults matching\\n\\nresults\\n\\nNo Results\\n\\nFilters\\n\\nFilters (\\n\\n\\nAll\\n\\nAdd tags\\n\\nAll\\n\\nAdd authors\\n\\nAll\\n\\nDocs Home\\n\\nGuides\\n\\nIPs, Networking & Domains\\n\\nVPNs: Virtual Private Networks\\n\\n\\n\\nSet up a Hardened OpenVPN Server on Debian 9\\n\\nUpdated\\nThursday, March 9, 2023, by Linode\\n\\nReport an Issue\\n\\nView File\\n\\nEdit File\\n\\nShare on Twitter\\n\\nShare on Facebook\\n\\nShare on Hacker News\\n\\nEstamos traduciendo nuestros guías y tutoriales al Español.

This is useful to remotely access services on a network or computer without making those services publicly accessible. When integrated with OpenSSL, OpenVPN encrypts all VPN traffic providing a secure connection between machines.\\n\\nAn OpenVPN connection consists of two flow channels between the server and clients: the Control Channel and the Data Channel. A client connects to the server by initiating a TLS session over the control channel, in which credentials are exchanged between server and clients to establish the data channel. The data channel is the encrypted pipeline in which all traffic between server and clients is then transmitted.\\n\\nThis guide is the first of a three-part series. Part one sets up a VPN server on Debian and prepares the access credentials for client devices. This VPN can be used to host internal services such as websites, game servers or file servers.\\n\\nPart two shows you how to set up a routed VPN so all traffic from client devices is tunneled through your Linode to the internet. Part three takes you through setting up the client-side software for various operating systems, including mobile platforms.\\n\\nBefore You Begin\\n\\nFamiliarize yourself with our Getting Started guide and set your Linode’s timezone.\\n\\nThis guide will use sudo wherever possible. Complete the sections of our Securing Your Server guide to create a standard user account, harden SSH access and remove unnecessary network services. Do not complete the steps in the Creating a Firewall section. This guide has instructions specifically for firewall rules for an OpenVPN server.\\n\\nUpdate the system:sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade\\n\\nManaging the OpenVPN Environment\\n\\nYou can manage the OpenVPN environment in two ways:\\n\\nThe first method uses OpenVPN Community Edition, where server and client configurations are manually edited and client credentials are distributed to their respective devices using SCP or SFTP. Alternatively, you could copy credentials to a desktop computer, edit them and then transfer them by USB.\\n\\nThe second method uses OpenVPN Access Server, a server-side application which lets you configure OpenVPN with your web browser. Client machines access a private URL from which to download their credential packages.\\n\\nFor small applications, OpenVPN Access Server is the more streamlined and user-friendly solution. The free version allows up to two simultaneous users. Although each user can have as many client devices as they like, a user’s clients will all have the same keys and certificates; more can be added by buying licensing. For more advanced configurations than what the GUI offers, you would still need to edit the VPN’s configuration files.\\n\\nIf you are interested in running OpenVPN Access Server on your Linode, see our guide: Secure Communications with OpenVPN Access Server. The remainder of this guide will focus on manual configuration using OpenVPN Community Edition.\\n\\nNetworking Configuration\\n\\nOpenVPN currently does not support a dual-stack configuration from a single instance where clients can connect to a server simultaneously using IPv4 and IPv6; one transport layer must be chosen or the other. Furthermore, only OpenVPN versions 2.3 and above support IPv6 over TUN devices. With versions earlier than 2.3, IPv6 can only be used with TAP devices.\\n\\nThis series assumes your VPN will operate over IPv4 only. If you instead wish to use IPv6, see OpenVPN’s documentation for more information.\\n\\nIPv4 Firewall Rules\\n\\nSwitch to the root user.su - root\\n\\nFlush any pre-existing rules and non-standard chains which may be in the system:iptables -F && iptables -X\\n\\nInstall iptables-persistent so any iptables rules we make now will be restored on succeeding bootups. When asked if you want to save the current IPv4 and IPv6 rules, choose No for both protocols.apt install iptables-persistent\\n\\nAdd IPv4 rules: iptables-persistent stores its rulesets in the files /etc/iptables/rules.v4 and /etc/iptables/rules.v6. Open the rules.v4 file and replace everything in it with the information below:NoteBy default, Linode distribution images are built with network interfaces renamed to eth0. If you are using a custom distribution, verify the name of your network interface, first:ip link show\\nReplace any instances of eth0 with the name of your network interface.File: /etc/iptables/rules.v4 1\\n 2\\n 3\\n 4\\n 5\\n 6\\n 7\\n 8\\n 9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\n46\\n*filter\\n\\n# Allow all loopback (lo) traffic and reject anything\\n# to localhost that does not originate from lo.\\n-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT\\n-A INPUT ! -i lo -s 127.0.0.0/8 -j REJECT\\n-A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT\\n\\n# Allow ping and ICMP error returns.\\n-A INPUT -p icmp -m state --state NEW --icmp-type 8 -j ACCEPT\\n-A INPUT -p icmp -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\\n-A OUTPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT\\n\\n# Allow SSH.\\n-A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED --dport 22 -j ACCEPT\\n-A OUTPUT -o eth0 -p tcp -m state --state ESTABLISHED --sport 22 -j ACCEPT\\n\\n# Allow UDP traffic on port 1194.\\n-A INPUT -i eth0 -p udp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED --dport 1194 -j ACCEPT\\n-A OUTPUT -o eth0 -p udp -m state --state ESTABLISHED --sport 1194 -j ACCEPT\\n\\n# Allow DNS resolution and limited HTTP/S on eth0.\\n# Necessary for updating the server and timekeeping.\\n-A INPUT -i eth0 -p udp -m state --state ESTABLISHED --sport 53 -j ACCEPT\\n-A OUTPUT -o eth0 -p udp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED --dport 53 -j ACCEPT\\n-A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -m state --state ESTABLISHED --sport 80 -j ACCEPT\\n-A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -m state --state ESTABLISHED --sport 443 -j ACCEPT\\n-A OUTPUT -o eth0 -p tcp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED --dport 80 -j ACCEPT\\n-A OUTPUT -o eth0 -p tcp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED --dport 443 -j ACCEPT\\n\\n# Allow traffic on the TUN interface so OpenVPN can communicate with eth0.\\n-A INPUT -i tun0 -j ACCEPT\\n-A OUTPUT -o tun0 -j ACCEPT\\n\\n# Log any packets which don\\'t fit the rules above.\\n# (optional but useful)\\n-A INPUT -m limit --limit 3/min -j LOG --log-prefix \"iptables_INPUT_denied: \" --log-level 4\\n-A FORWARD -m limit --limit 3/min -j LOG --log-prefix \"iptables_FORWARD_denied: \" --log-level 4\\n-A OUTPUT -m limit --limit 3/min -j LOG --log-prefix \"iptables_OUTPUT_denied: \" --log-level 4\\n\\n# then reject them.\\n-A INPUT -j REJECT\\n-A FORWARD -j REJECT\\n-A OUTPUT -j REJECT\\n\\nCOMMIT\\n\\nYou will disable IPv6 in the next section, so add an ip6tables ruleset to reject all IPv6 traffic:cat >> /etc/iptables/rules.v6 << END\\n*filter\\n\\n-A INPUT -j REJECT\\n-A FORWARD -j REJECT\\n-A OUTPUT -j REJECT\\n\\nCOMMIT\\nEND\\n\\nActivate the rulesets immediately and verify:iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/rules.v4\\nip6tables-restore < /etc/iptables/rules.v6\\nYou can see your loaded rules with sudo iptables -S.

Answer Yes when asked if you want to save the current IPv4 and IPv6 rules.dpkg-reconfigure iptables-persistent\\n\\nDisable IPv6\\n\\nIf you are exclusively using IPv4 on your VPN, IPv6 should be disabled unless you have a specific reason not to do so.\\n\\nAdd the following kernel parameters for systemd-sysctl to set on boot:cat >> /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf << END\\n\\nnet.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1\\nnet.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1\\nnet.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1\\nnet.ipv6.conf.eth0.disable_ipv6 = 1\\nEND\\n\\nActivate them immediately:sysctl -p\\n\\nComment out the line for IPv6 resolution over localhost in /etc/hosts:File: /etc/hosts1\\n#::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback\\n\\nInstall and Begin Configuring OpenVPN\\n\\nInstall OpenVPN from the OpenVPN Project’s repository. Choose OpenVPN’s repo over Debian’s so that you’ll always have the most up to date build for Debian Stretch:wget -O - https://swupdate.openvpn.net/repos/repo-public.gpg|apt-key add -\\necho \"deb http://build.openvpn.net/debian/openvpn/stable stretch main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/openvpn-aptrepo.list\\napt update && apt install openvpn\\n\\nBy default, OpenVPN runs as root. The user nobody given in the server.conf template has fewer privileges than root. If nobody gets compromised, the intruder will have access to processes running as the nobody user. This can include Apache when using mod_php, various NFS mounts and some cron jobs. Forcing OpenVPN to run as its own exclusive user and group is a good way to isolate it from other processes, especially if you will also be hosting a web or file server on the same host as your VPN.Create a new user account and group for the OpenVPN daemon to run as after startup. The name ovpn is used as an example.adduser --system --shell /usr/sbin/nologin --no-create-home ovpn\\ngroupadd ovpn\\nusermod -g ovpn ovpn\\n\\nRequire a matching HMAC signature for all packets involved in the TLS handshake between the server and connecting clients. Packets without this signature are dropped. To generate the HMAC signature file:openvpn --genkey --secret /etc/openvpn/server/ta.key\\n\\nGenerate Diffie-Hellman parameter. This is a set of randomly generated data used when establishing Perfect Forward Secrecy during creation of a client’s session key. The default size is 2048 bits, but OpenVPN’s documentation recommends to use a prime size equivalent to your RSA key size. Since you will be using 4096 bit RSA keys, create a 4096 bit DH prime. Depending on the size of your Linode, this could take approximately 10 minutes to complete.openssl genpkey -genparam -algorithm DH -out /etc/openvpn/server/dhp4096.pem -pkeyopt dh_paramgen_prime_len:4096\\nAccording to OpenSSL’s man page, genpkey -genparam supersedes dhparam.\\n\\nExit from the root shell and back to your standard user account.\\n\\nVPN Certificate Authority\\n\\nClient certificates and keys should be not be managed directly on your VPN server. They should be created locally on a computer and stored offline. For the best quality entropy, they should be created on a computer which has a powerful CPU. You should avoid doing this on a virtual machine.\\n\\nYou can generate certificates and keys two ways: by using EasyRSA scripts, or by creating your own public key infrastructure for your VPN, which includes customizations not included in the default OpenSSL configuration file.\\n\\nThe rest of this guide will use EasyRSA.\\n\\nConfigure EasyRSA\\n\\nIf you’re using a local Unix-based operating system, install the package easy-rsa onto your local computer (CentOS will first need the EPEL repositories installed). For OS X or Windows, grab the .zip archive from the project’s Github repository.\\n\\nMake your a root directory for the Certificate Authority. The location of your CA is arbitrary, but for the purposes of this guide make a folder called ca in your user’s home directory as an example. The certificates are created from that directory.make-cadir ~/ca && cd ~/ca\\n\\nCreate a symbolic link from openssl-1.1.0.cnf to openssl.cnf:ln -s openssl-1.0.0.cnf openssl.cnf\\n\\nThe vars file created in /ca contains presets used by EasyRSA. Here you can specify a distinguished name for your certificate authority that will be passed to client certificates. Changing these fields is optional, and you can always input them manually during certificate creation, but setting them here creates less work during client certificate creation.File: ~/ca/vars1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n# These are the default values for fields\\n# which will be placed in the certificate.\\n# Don\\'t leave any of these fields blank.\\nexport KEY_COUNTRY=\"US\"\\nexport KEY_PROVINCE=\"CA\"\\nexport KEY_CITY=\"SanFrancisco\"\\nexport KEY_ORG=\"Fort-Funston\"\\nexport KEY_EMAIL=\"me@myhost.mydomain\"\\nexport KEY_OU=\"MyOrganizationalUnit\"\\n\\nFrom ~/ca, source the vars script:source ./vars\\nThis will return:NOTE: If you run ./clean-all, I will be doing a rm -rf on /home/user/ca/keys\\n\\nRun the clean-all script to create the keys directory and its containing files:./clean-all\\n\\nServer Credentials\\n\\nA root certificate, sometimes called a Certificate Authority, is the certificate and key pair that will be used to generate key pairs for clients and intermediate authorities (on this VPN server there are none). At each prompt, add or edit the information to be used in your certificate, or leave them blank. Use your VPN server’s hostname or some other identifier as the Common Name and leave the challenge password blank../build-ca\\n\\nThen create the server’s private key, add or edit the information prompts as needed:./build-key-server server\\nWhen you’ve completed the question section for the private key, confirm the signing of the certificate and the certificate requests certified by answering yes to those two questions.\\n\\nUpload the server credentials to your Linode, using scp from your local computer:scp ./keys/{ca.crt,server.crt,server.key} root@<your_linode\\'s_IP>:/etc/openvpn/server\\n\\nYou’ll also want a copy of the HMAC key you created earlier to distribute to each client device:scp root@<your_linode\\'s_IP>:/etc/openvpn/server/ta.key ./keys\\n\\nClient Credentials\\n\\nEach client device connecting to the VPN should have its own unique key and identifier (client1, client2, etc.). All other certificate information can remain the same and be shared across all client devices. If you need to add users at any time later, just repeat this step using a different client name.\\n\\nAnyone with access to \\n\\nOpenVPN Configuration Files\\n\\nServer Configuration File\\n\\nOpenVPN’s server-side configuration file is /etc/openvpn/server.conf.

If you intend to use your OpenVPN server as an extension of your local network, or for hosting services you want to access from your LAN, you would need to configure the specific applications for your use.\\n\\nIf you want your VPN server to forward and receive traffic to/from the internet on behalf of VPN clients, see part two of this series: Tunnel Your Internet Traffic Through an OpenVPN Server.

It doesn’t rely on rules and regulations to protect your privacy, or any other form of trust in third parties to take up the cause for you. Instead it technologically makes the compromise of data that is encrypted damn near impossible to see by those whom you don’t want to see it.\\n\\nIn other words, encryption is a beautiful thing in the world of privacy and security, and probably the ultimate solution. The more the use of encryption spreads among internet users the safer we will all be from criminals and bad governments. Once a critical mass of users start taking advantage of encryption big corporations such as Google, Facebook and others will be more pressured to incorporate encryption solutions into their own services making encryption a standard rather than an exception.\\n\\nUnfortunately, for a long time it has been rather inconvenient and difficult for most people to use, and it is still largely perceived as such, which slows down its adoption. Luckily, things are changing for the better, and I think awareness of those improvements ought to catch up. So in the interest of showing how easy it has become to use encryption in a wide variety of areas of online activity here is a selection of 15 encryption tools which you can use quite easily.\\n\\n1. Enlocked.com encrypted email\\n\\nPerhaps the most difficult to encrypt easily is email communication, mainly because most people don’t encrypt their email yet both sides have to be involved in the process. If you send an encrypted email to someone he or she has to be able to decrypt it. Most people use popular services such as GMail which don’t have encryption support integrated and easy to use.\\n\\nThat’s where third party solutions come in, and Enlocked.com is among better ones. It is a browser plugin which adds a “Send Secured” button to your GMail compose message interface. Click the button after writing your message and it will ask whether you want to send a standard message or a message with an introduction where you can explain to the recipient why are you encrypting the message and/or how to decrypt it (basically, install Enlocked). It asks no further questions.\\n\\nIf the recipient is also using GMail, and installs the Enlocked plugin, (s)he can read the message instantly. If the recipient is using a different unsupported email provider (s)he will be shown a “Read Message” button leading to Enlocked.com, have to make an account, and afterwards be instructed to download the .asc file from the received email, upload it to Enlocked.com, and it will decrypt it.\\n\\nGranted in the latter case it is not as straightforward as most would hope, but it’s not a terribly complicated process, and the ability to send an unencrypted introduction along with the encrypted message helps quite a bit.\\n\\nFor GMail users, however, it is straightforward enough that you could theoretically get all of the people you’re emailing to just install the Enlocked plugin and you’d be good to go. This makes it feasible for entire companies or groups working on projects to wholesale start using encryption in their email communication.\\n\\nIn addition to Chrome, Enlocked also offers plugins for Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, iPhone, Android, and Outlook, and offers video demos showing how it works.\\n\\nAn alternative that may be worth a mention is Mailvelope, but I didn’t find it to be as straightforward since you have to create or import your own contacts along with their keys.\\n\\nIt is also worth noting that GMail natively supports encrypting the connection between their servers and your web browser. This option is enabled by default for Chrome users, but if you want to make sure it is enabled for you just go to GMail settings and make sure “Always use HTTPS” option is selected.\\n\\nA more complete solution for securing your email is to open an account at CounterMail.com which offers advanced security and encryption for your email. It is a paid service, but offers one month for a free trial.\\n\\n2. DropKey\\n\\nWhile only available for Mac users as of now DropKey is a very elegant solution for sending encrypted files via email without any hassle. As the name implies all that’s necessary is to drop a file into the dropkey icon in the menu bar, specify the email address of the recipient, and click send. This will encrypt the file, open up Mail compose window with the encrypted file attached, and allow you to send it right away. Only that recipient will be able to decrypt it.\\n\\nOf course, in order to be able to encrypt the file for a specific recipient you need his public key, so DropKey also includes an easy way to send the public key. You can then store it with that recipient’s email address so that when you specify that recipient the file will automatically be encrypted with his key.\\n\\nDropKey therefore represents the easiest to use implementation of complete public key encryption, at least for emailing files back and forth, that I’ve seen thus far. Mac users should definitely check it out.\\n\\n3. Crypto.cat secure chat\\n\\nA lot of people chat on IRC or IM (MSN, AIM, etc.), but most of those chats aren’t secured. Crypto.cat offers a very easy way to start chatting with people more securely, when you want to be sure you can’t be snooped on. Simply go to Crypto.cat, install a plugin for your browser, start a conversation with a unique name, and share the name of the conversation with whomever you want to chat. People who want to join your conversation just have to enter that conversation name when connecting.\\n\\nOnce connected your whole conversation is encrypted. To initiate a one-on-one private chat just click on the nick of a person you want to chat with.\\n\\nCrypto.cat supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and also works on a Mac.\\n\\nThe only issue with it is that most people aren’t likely to bother using Crypto.cat for their conversations if they already have their contacts conveniently in AIM, MSN, Skype or established IRC channels. That’s where the next solution might help. One little note though; Skype conversations are supposed to be encrypted, as well as voice calls, but there is some controversy over how solid its security is.\\n\\n4. Pidgin with OTR (Off-the-Record messaging)\\n\\nPidgin is a free instant messaging client which supports many IM networks including AIM, MSN, ICQ, Facebook Chat, Yahoo, XMPP, and more. It is very simple and easy to use, and it’s especially great if you use multiple networks and want to have them all in one place.\\n\\nBy default Pidgin doesn’t have encryption supported, but there is a ready made and easy to install plugin at CypherPunks web site which adds this functionality. Once installed, restart Pidgin, go to Tools > Plugins, find “Off-the-Record Messaging” in the list and enable it. Next time you start a conversation with someone you’ll see an OTR menu that allows you to “start a private conversation”.\\n\\nThe only catch is that the other person has to have a client that supports OTR as well, but Pidgin being so nice you might be able to convince them to use it too.\\n\\n5. Gibberbot Android instant messaging\\n\\nWe’re still in the realm of secure instant messaging, but this time for smartphones. Gibberbot is actually just an instant messaging client for Android which supports OTR. It works with Google, Facebook Chat, Jabber, and other Jabber based instant messaging networks. This also means that you can chat with someone using Pidgin on the desktop with OTR plugin enabled, and have a secure conversation.\\n\\n6. RedPhone & TextSecure encrypted calls and texts\\n\\nRedPhone enables a simple way of upgrading your normal phone calls to encrypted phone calls whenever the other person has RedPhone installed as well. There is no need for a new phone number or any kind of extra identifier, and you still use phone’s default dialer to make calls. It simply asks you, upon placing a call, if you want to make it through RedPhone.\\n\\nTo start using it just install RedPhone from Google Play, launch and go through a simple registration process, which will verify your phone number via SMS.\\n\\nBesides encryption the added benefit is that it then uses Wi-Fi or 3G to make the call so you could potentially also save a bit on call fees. In that sense it reminds a bit of similar services like Viber, but with encryption added to the package.\\n\\nTextSecure, coming from the same developer, is the same story, but for text messages. It allows you to send encrypted text messages to other TextSecure users while using the same mobile phone number as you do normally.\\n\\nEvidently, it takes two to tango, again, so this only works if you convince those whom you regularly call or message to install and use RedPhone and/or TextSecure as well.\\n\\n7. 0bin.net secure pastes\\n\\nEvery now and then we might have a piece of text to share with someone, and one of the most convenient solutions that has sprung up for this purpose are online pastebins. The piece of text could be anything from a funny status message from a non-mutual friend, an interesting conversation transcript, an Anonymous call to action (or plan of action), or a piece of code. Sometimes the contents of this might be something you don’t want just sitting publicly on a pastebin site, and that’s where 0bin.net comes in.\\n\\n0bin.net\\xa0(that’s a zero, not O) encrypts what you paste and creates a link that you can share with whomever you want. So it operates much like other pastebin services except that it ensures nobody else but the ones that get the link can actually see what you pasted. Additionally 0bin.net also allows uploading a file, so it can serve for some secure private file sharing as well.\\n\\n8. TrueCrypt encrypted virtual volumes\\n\\nSpeaking of files there may be some that you don’t want others to know even exist, or some that simply contain information you don’t want anyone to know about. If you’ve got files that you’d rather keep “classified” TrueCrypt can come in very handy.\\n\\nWith TrueCrypt you can create an entire new virtual volume, like a new partition or a hard drive, but the volume can actually be just a file of a certain size placed anywhere on your desktop. When you create this virtual volume it is encrypted and you provide a passphrase with which to decrypt it. This file can then be mounted as a virtual volume with TrueCrypt whenever you want to access files already inside, or put new files into it. Once unmounted nobody but you with your passphrase can access what’s inside nor can they crack into it.\\n\\nThe actual file that contains the virtual volume doesn’t have to have any extensions. For testing purposes I created a file simply called “nothing”. It opens with nothing automatically, has no information associated with it, but I know that it’s actually a secret vault with my super-secret stuff in it.\\n\\n9. AxCrypt file encryption\\n\\nAxCrypt is different from TrueCrypt in that it encrypts only single individual files rather than allowing creation of virtual volumes. It also doesn’t create encrypted folder archives (see below for that). If you tell AxCrypt to encrypt a folder it will just go file by file and encrypt each file individually rather than creating an encrypted package or archive.\\n\\nIt’s simple to install, and it just adds an AxCrypt menu to the right-click menu for your files which offers all of the file encryption options. You can choose to delete the original unencrypted file or leave it as is. That’s all there is to it.\\n\\n10. 7-Zip encrypted archives\\n\\nThis archiving utility is very useful regardless of whether you use it to encrypt files or not due to its support of great number of archiving formats including its own (.7z), but it includes the ability to create encrypted .7z and .zip archives easily as well.\\n\\nOnce 7-Zip is installed it will place a menu in your right-click menu with all of the options. To create an encrypted archive of your folder right click on it, select 7-Zip > Add to archive, and in a dialog that appears you can select the archive format (only .zip and .7z support encryption), set other options as you wish, and in the “Encryption” section choose your password and encryption method (default and possibly only choice will be AES-256). You can also choose to encrypt the file names as well.\\n\\nOnce all is set click OK and you’ll get an encrypted archive of the selected folder that you can open only if you enter a password you set.\\n\\n11. SpiderOak Encrypted Backup\\n\\nIt’s always a great idea to have a backup of your files in case your hard drive goes caput, and cloud based backup services have been gaining traction as the residential connection speeds have been increasing. However, having all of your files backed up onto servers somewhere far away might make you nervous (and rightfully so). So what would be the solution to this issue? Encrypting all of the backed up files, of course.\\n\\nThat’s what SpiderOak offers. Of course, you could certainly use TrueCrypt to create an encrypted file that can be mounted as a virtual volume, put a bunch of your sensitive files in there, and just drop it into dropbox. Nobody would be able to access those files but you, so you’d have a secure backup.\\n\\nBut if you want to backup all of your files or a pretty large number of them this solution would probably be impractical. With SpiderOak you can make and automatically maintain a backup of all of your files, or any you select, and have it encrypted on their servers. Nobody without your SpiderOak password would have access to them, not even SpiderOak employees themselves.\\n\\nJust register with SpiderOak, download their software, select what you want to backup, let it do its thing, and keep it running whenever you want your backups to be synced. For a full review of SpiderOak visit this article. Any issues that have been mentioned in that review were likely fixed by now.\\n\\n12. Mega file sharing and storage\\n\\nLaunched with mega fanfare at the beginning of 2013 Mega promises a file sharing and storage solution with complete privacy. All of the data saved in Mega is encrypted, and should be inaccessible even to Mega employees themselves. Mega can generate a private link for each uploaded file that you can share with others.\\n\\nBesides that the interface is really simple and easy to use, so Mega represents an option for secure encrypted file sharing or even backup purposes.\\n\\n13. Virtual Private Network (VPN)\\n\\nVirtual Private Network services available today certainly fall into the category of easy to use encryption tools, and the benefit is the ability to make your entire internet connection encrypted and thus private. Your ISP no longer can see which sites you visit, nor can anyone snoop in on your connection to see which sites you’re visiting and what you’re doing.\\n\\nWe’ve already written about VPNs and why you should use them before. One good VPN provider I can recommend is Private Internet Access, which supports many platforms, offers many servers, doesn’t keep logs, and accepts many payment methods including Bitcoin, which we will talk about in a bit. Like most others they also offer a simple app which you can use to connect to a VPN server, in addition to plenty of tutorials on alternative ways to connect on different platforms (including Android).\\n\\nIt is a paid service, but you do get what you pay for, mainly in terms of connection speed and stability. Free VPN providers like ProXPN exist, but their bandwidth and speed is limited, and you can really feel it. With paid providers such as Private Internet Access you can barely notice you’re connected through a VPN.\\n\\n14. Bitcoin\\n\\nBitcoin is a digital currency which uses encryption to make all transactions as private and secure as they can possibly be. This is why it is also often referred to as a cryptocurrency. It has been dramatically growing in popularity as of late, which spurred higher demand for bitcoins and therefore a dramatic rise in its price. As of this writing it is hovering above $100 USD for only 1 BTC (abbreviation for Bitcoin), which is stunning.\\n\\nBelieve it or not it is not that hard to start using bitcoin. While there are ways of setting it up that seem complicated, mainly involving download of wallet software and making sure you back it up so you don’t lose your bitcoins, online wallet providers such as Blockchain.info make this job tremendously easy.\\n\\nSimply sign up, confirm your email address, and you have a wallet along with your first bitcoin address that you can give to someone who would send you some bitcoins. Blockchain.info allows you to add multiple other addresses which you can mark for various different purposes, but all of the money resides in that single wallet. It also supports one click backup of your wallet to your email address so you can’t lose your bitcoins so easily.\\n\\nBuying bitcoins isn’t that hard either. Blockchain.info offers a number of options for various regions that you can use to fund your account. You can also buy bitcoins on Coinbase.com, which allows you to link your bank account, and then send those to one of the addresses in your blockchain.info wallet if you wish.\\n\\nIf you have a business or something to sell it’s no longer a crazy idea to try and get paid via bitcoins, as more and more people are using it. And bitcoins are also being accepted by a fast growing number of both online and offline businesses. For example Reddit accepts bitcoins for their Reddit Gold accounts, and a popular domain name service Namecheap accepts bitcoins for purchasing or renewing domain names.\\n\\nWe will likely have more to say about Bitcoin in the future, but suffice it to say that it represents a great way of simplifying, securing, and making private at least some of your money transactions (those which you can practically and efficiently conduct using Bitcoin).\\n\\n15. Silent Circle (Paid)\\n\\nSilent Circle offers a suite of easy to use products that enable encrypted communication across the board. They offer Silent Phone, Silent Text, Silent Eyes, and Silent Mail which offer encryption of phone calls, text messages, video calls and emails respectively.\\n\\nThese probably work much like RedPhone and TextSecure mentioned above, with minimum intrusion. If you are talking, texting, video calling or emailing with another Silent Circle member your link to that person is fully encrypted. That’s the whole idea, and given the professionalism of how they present the service, and the all-in-one feel of it, this is likely to work quite well.\\n\\nThe price is $84 for three months or $240 for 12 months, which might be a bit high for most people so I imagine this will at first appeal mainly to business users who want to ensure total privacy of their communications, but for those who can afford it and want to be part of the circle badly enough this is definitely worth checking out.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe use of encryption may have been hard enough in the past to be inaccessible to most people, but as the above services clearly demonstrate that is becoming a thing of the past. If you combine all of the above tools you would provide yourself with near total encryption of your online activity and your communications, and the more people you convince to start using same or similar tools the more privacy there will be all around.\\n\\nIt’s hard to change our habits though, and the pull of convenience is very powerful, but the ease of use of these tools should help convince us to at least gradually start breaking in new habits that can overall improve our privacy and security. After all it doesn’t cost anything to install RedPhone, TextSecure, and Gibberbot on your phone, Enlocked plugin on your browser, and OTR supporting IM client like Pidgin for your IM conversations, and then simply recommend others to start using them as well. Your digital devices will be ready to use encryption whenever practical, and that’s a decent first step towards making encryption a standard practice among internet users.\\n\\nFollow Us!\\n\\nRate this article:\\n\\n2.67                 /\\n\\n5\\n                (\\n\\n3 votes)\\n\\nMail this article\\n\\nPrint this article\\n\\nRelated Posts\\n\\nIT Certifications vs. College Degrees\\n\\nWhich is more valuable, an IT certification or a college degree?\\xa0 While the answer to ...\\n\\n10 Tiny Gadgets that Pack a Huge Punch\\n\\nWise men sometimes say that “less is more”, and looking at technological developments it would ...\\n\\nThe Rebirth of Linux\\n\\nThere were quite a few words on the death of Linux on the desktop lately, ...\\n\\nGot Something To Say: Cancel reply\\n\\nYour email address will not be published.

in\\n\\nCircuits\\n\\nMicrocontrollers\\n\\n96,698\\n\\n72\\n\\n28\\n\\nFavorite\\n\\nIntroduction: Getting Started With Ubuntu and the AVR Dragon\\n\\nBy }{itch\\n\\nFollow\\n\\nMore by the author:\\n\\nHere\\'s what i did to get started using the AVR Dragon to program ATMEGA8 microcontrollers using ubuntu (This is aimed at beginners, I myself am also being a beginner, so any improvements from more experienced users  are greatly appreciated).\\nAfter finally switching my laptop and computer over to ubuntu permanently, i found no software that would support my PIC microcontroller programmer and after a few vauge and useless attempts to reverse engineer it (i\\'m really not that good at electronics, i wake up in the night wondering why i\\'m not doing a degree to become a tree surgeon), i finally thought \"sod it\" and splashed out a bit of my student loan on an AVR Dragon after seeing there was an open source c compiler for AVR microcontrollers and supporting programming software, also there\\'s some absolutely wicked projects people have done with them.\\nIt then promptly got discarded in my box of bits for a couple of months (i like to think it was laying dormant in its lair......its a dragon, get the pun?)\\nso anyways, here\\'s how i got it working, this will probably work with most flavours of ubuntu that use synaptic (you can probably do it on any version of linux if you compile it from source and whatnot, i like synaptic because its easy) and its more a collection of information from various sources, but should hopefully get you up and running!\\nI realise there are other instructables for getting started with avr microcontrollers, but i couldn\\'t find anything that applied to my situation, so i hope this is at least a bit of help to somebody.\\n\\nStep 1: Getting the Software\\n\\nin this instructable i wont be using any IDE (integrated development environment,  think netbeans or visual basic) or make files (i don\\'t understand them, maybe one day i will), so its mainly gonna be done via the command line and the text editor of your choice.there are 2 main pieces of software i\\'ll be usinggcc-avrthis is the gnu c cross compiler for avr microcntrollers. A cross compiler is needed because we\\'re compiling code for a microcontroller on an architecture (personal computer) that cannot run the compiled code.This will take the code you write in c and convert it into a \"machine readable\" format (loads of 1\\'s and 0\\'s) which can then be put onto a microcontroller.avrdudeThis is what puts the code onto the microcontroller, it connects with the avr dragon and transfers the Hex file (the compiled code) onto the microcontroller.to install these pieces of software go: system -> administration -> Synaptic Package Managersearch for gcc-avr and then avrdude and mark them both for installation, then install! simple.if you want to use the command line you could trysudo apt-get install gcc-avrsudo apt-get install avrdude\\n\\nStep 2: Compiling the Code With Gcc-avr\\n\\nhttp://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__demo__project.html\\n\\nhttp://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__demo__project.html )\\n\\nAttachments\\n\\niocompat.hDownload\\n\\nflash.cDownload\\n\\nflash.hexDownload\\n\\nStep 3: A Bit About the Dragon\\n\\nThe avr dragon is a pretty mean bit of kit, it supports loads of different kinds of way to program avr microntrollers, it even has JTAG! (note the added enthusiasm to mask the fact i don\\'t actually know what JTAG is, from what i\\'ve heard it sounds fun, i\\'ll hopefully get round to learning about it someday.)Of worthy note is it has in-circuit debugging, a similar system for PIC microcontrollers will set you back near Ã\\x83Â\\x82Ã\\x82Â£100 (the MPLAB ICD2, we use them alot at uni), i bought my dragon from http://www.rapidonline.com for around Ã\\x83Â\\x82Ã\\x82Â£34, so i was rather chuffed.There is a large area on the board for you to add your own headers and ZIF socket\\'s ect. i had none of these to hand so i kept it simple and used ISP to program my avr.(for a brilliant instructable on populating the empty bits see this )so to use the ISP thingy we need an ISP cable!forward to the next step!\\n\\nStep 4: Making the ISP Cable\\n\\nStep 5: Building the Circuit\\n\\nNow its time to build up the circuit!, follow the schematic below and everything should be hunkydory. (i apologise if its a bit scruffy, i was doing power ballad fists to david bowie while drawing it, if there\\'s any confusion the circuit diagram from http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__demo__project.html is fairly close, but we don\\'t need the crystal as the avr is running on its internal 1MHZ oscillator)if you grab a copy of the datasheet for the microcontroller things may be a bit clearer.Make sure the LED and resistor are connected to the pin labelled OC1 or OC1A.Check lots of times to make sure all the ISP pins go to the right place on the microcontroller, if you do it wrong you may risk damaging the Dragon (or slaying it) or hurting the microcontroller, neither of which you really want to happen.now you have all that set-up it should look something similar to the second picture (hopefully allot less scruffy).now that done lets get on with dumping the hex file onto this badboy.\\n\\nStep 6: Writing the Hex File\\n\\nStep 7: All Done!\\n\\nhttp://www.ladyada.net/library/avrdevtut/index.html\\n\\nhttp://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__demo__project.html\\n\\nhttp://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/user-manual/avrdude_4.html#SEC4\\n\\nhttps://www.instructables.com/id/Ghetto-Programming%3a-Getting-started-with-AVR-micro/\\n\\nhttps://www.instructables.com/id/AVR-mini-board-with-additional-boards/\\n\\nhttps://www.instructables.com/id/Ghetto-Development-Environment/\\n\\nBe the First to Share\\n\\nDid you make this project?

Clients with different needs directly interact with appropriate cluster components.[22]\\n\\nCeph distributes data across multiple storage devices and nodes to achieve higher throughput, in a fashion similar to RAID. Adaptive load balancing is supported whereby frequently accessed services may be replicated over more nodes.[23]\\n\\n[update]\\n\\n[24]\\n\\nXFS was the recommended underlying filesystem for Filestore OSDs, and\\n\\nBtrfs could be used at one\\'s own risk.\\n\\next4 filesystems were not recommended due to limited metadata capacity.\\n\\n[25]\\n\\n[26]\\n\\nObject storage S3[edit]\\n\\nCeph implements distributed object storage via the  \\nRADOS GateWay (ceph-rgw), which exposes the underlying storage layer via an interface compatible with Amazon S3 or OpenStack Swift.\\n\\nBig Data (datalake),\\n\\nbackups &\\n\\narchives,\\n\\nIOT, media, video recording, and deployment images for\\n\\nvirtual machines and\\n\\ncontainers.\\n\\nCeph\\'s software libraries provide client applications with direct access to the reliable autonomic distributed object store (RADOS) object-based storage system.  More frequently used are libraries for Ceph\\'s RADOS Block Device (RBD), RADOS Gateway, and Ceph File System services. In this way, administrators can maintain their storage devices within a unified system, which makes it easier to replicate and protect the data.\\n\\nsoftware libraries provide access in\\n\\nC,\\n\\nC++,\\n\\nJava,\\n\\nPHP, and\\n\\nPython. The RADOS Gateway also exposes the object store as a\\n\\nRESTful interface which can present as both native\\n\\nAmazon S3 and\\n\\nOpenStack Swift APIs.\\n\\nBlock storage[edit]\\n\\nCeph can provide clients with thin-provisioned block devices. When an application writes data to Ceph using a block device, Ceph automatically stripes and replicates the data across the cluster. Ceph\\'s RADOS Block Device (RBD) also integrates with Kernel-based Virtual Machines (KVMs).\\n\\nCeph block storage may be deployed on traditional HDDs and/or SSDs which are associated with Ceph\\'s block storage for use cases, including databases, virtual machines, data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.  Block storage clients often require high throughput and IOPS, thus Ceph RBD deployments increasingly utilize SSDs with NVMe interfaces.\\n\\n\"RBD\" is built on with Ceph\\'s foundational RADOS object storage system that provides the librados interface and the CephFS file system. Since RBD is built on librados, RBD inherits librados\\'s abilities, including clones and snapshots. By striping volumes across the cluster, Ceph improves performance for large block device images.\\n\\n\"Ceph-iSCSI\" is a gateway which enables access to distributed, highly available block storage from Microsoft Windows and VMware vSphere servers or clients capable of speaking the iSCSI protocol. By using ceph-iscsi on one or more iSCSI gateway hosts, Ceph RBD images become available as Logical Units (LUs) associated with iSCSI targets, which can be accessed in an optionally load-balanced, highly available fashion.\\n\\nSince ceph-iscsi configuration is stored in the Ceph RADOS object store, ceph-iscsi gateway hosts are inherently without persistent state and thus can be replaced, augmented, or reduced at will. As a result, Ceph Storage enables customers to run a truly distributed, highly-available, resilient, and self-healing enterprise storage technology on commodity hardware and an entirely open source platform.\\n\\nOpenshift,\\n\\nOpenStack,\\n\\nKubernetes,\\n\\nOpenNebula,\\n\\nGaneti,\\n\\nApache CloudStack and\\n\\nProxmox Virtual Environment.\\n\\nFile storage[edit]\\n\\nCeph\\'s file system (CephFS) runs on top of the same RADOS foundation as Ceph\\'s object storage and block device services. The CephFS metadata server (MDS) provides a service that maps the directories and file names of the file system to objects stored within RADOS clusters. The metadata server cluster can expand or contract, and it can rebalance file system metadata ranks dynamically to distribute data evenly among cluster hosts. This ensures high performance and prevents heavy loads on specific hosts within the cluster.\\n\\nClients mount the POSIX-compatible file system using a Linux kernel client. An older FUSE-based client is also available. The servers run as regular Unix daemons.\\n\\nCeph\\'s file storage is often associated with log collection, messaging, and file storage.\\n\\nDashboard[edit]\\n\\nFrom 2018 there is also a Dashboard UI project, which helps to manage the cluster. It\\'s being developed by Ceph community on LGPL-3 and uses Ceph-mgr, Python, Angular framework and Grafana.[27] Landing page has been refreshed in the beginning of 2023.[28]\\n\\nPrevious dashboards were developed but are closed now: Calamari (2013-2018), OpenAttic (2013-2019), VSM (2014-2016), Inkscope (2015-2016) and Ceph-adm (2015-2017).[29]\\n\\nCrimson[edit]\\n\\nNVMe and\\n\\n3D_XPoint have become much faster than\\n\\nHDD and even SAS/SATA\\n\\nSSDs, but CPU performance has not kept pace. Moreover\\n\\ncrimson-osd is meant to be a backward-compatible drop-in replacement for\\n\\nceph-osd. While Crimson can work with the BlueStore back end (via AlienStore), a new native ObjectStore implementation called SeaStore is also being developed along with CyanStore for testing purposes. One reason for creating SeaStore is that transaction support in the BlueStore back end is provided by\\n\\nRocksDB, which needs to be re-implemented to achieve better parallelism.\\n\\n[30]\\n\\n[31]\\n\\n[32]\\n\\nHistory[edit]\\n\\nSage Weil for his\\n\\ndoctoral dissertation,\\n\\n[33]\\n\\nJack Baskin School of Engineering,\\n\\nUniversity of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), and sponsored by the\\n\\nAdvanced Simulation and Computing Program (ASC), including\\n\\nLos Alamos National Laboratory (LANL),\\n\\nSandia National Laboratories (SNL), and\\n\\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL).\\n\\n[34]\\n\\n[35]\\n\\nUSENIX OSDI 2006\\n\\n[36]\\n\\nSC\\'06.\\n\\n[37]\\n\\nLinus Torvalds merged the Ceph client into Linux kernel version 2.6.34\\n\\n[38]\\n\\n[39]\\n\\nInktank Storage for professional services and support for Ceph.\\n\\n[40]\\n\\n[41]\\n\\nIn April 2014, Red Hat purchased Inktank, bringing the majority of Ceph development in-house to make it a production version for enterprises with support (hotline) and continuous maintenance (new versions).[42]\\n\\nRed Hat,\\n\\nIntel,\\n\\nCanonical,\\n\\nCERN,\\n\\nCisco,\\n\\nFujitsu,\\n\\nSanDisk, and\\n\\nSUSE.\\n\\n[43]\\n\\nCanonical,\\n\\nChina Mobile,\\n\\nDigitalOcean,\\n\\nIntel,\\n\\nOVH, ProphetStor Data Services,\\n\\nRed Hat, SoftIron,\\n\\nSUSE,\\n\\nWestern Digital, XSKY Data Technology, and\\n\\nZTE.\\n\\n[44]\\n\\nIn March 2021, SUSE discontinued its Enterprise Storage product incorporating Ceph in favor of Longhorn,[45] and the former Enterprise Storage website was updated stating \"SUSE has refocused the storage efforts around serving our strategic SUSE Enterprise Storage Customers and are no longer actively selling SUSE Enterprise Storage.\"[46]\\n\\nRelease history[edit]\\n\\nArgonaut\\n\\nOld version, no longer maintained: 0.48\\n\\nJuly 3, 2012\\n\\nFirst major \"stable\" release\\n\\nBobtail\\n\\nOld version, no longer maintained: 0.56\\n\\nJanuary 1, 2013\\n\\nCuttlefish\\n\\nOld version, no longer maintained: 0.61\\n\\nMay 7, 2013\\n\\nceph-deploy is stable\\n\\nDumpling\\n\\nOld version, no longer maintained: 0.67\\n\\nAugust 14, 2013\\n\\nMay 2015\\n\\nnamespace, region, monitoring REST API\\n\\nEmperor\\n\\nOld version, no longer maintained: 0.72\\n\\nNovember 9, 2013\\n\\nMay 2014\\n\\nmulti-datacenter replication for RGW\\n\\nFirefly\\n\\nOld version, no longer maintained: 0.80\\n\\nMay 7, 2014\\n\\nApril 2016\\n\\nerasure coding, cache tiering, primary affinity, key/value OSD backend (experimental), standalone RGW (experimental)\\n\\nGiant\\n\\nOld version, no longer maintained: 0.87\\n\\nOctober 29, 2014\\n\\nApril 2015\\n\\nHammer\\n\\nOld version, no longer maintained: 0.94\\n\\nApril 7, 2015\\n\\nAugust 2017\\n\\nInfernalis\\n\\nOld version, no longer maintained: 9.2.0\\n\\nNovember 6, 2015\\n\\nApril 2016\\n\\nJewel\\n\\nOld version, no longer maintained: 10.2.0\\n\\nApril 21, 2016\\n\\n2018-06-01\\n\\nStable CephFS, experimental OSD back end named BlueStore, daemons no longer run as the root user\\n\\nKraken\\n\\nOld version, no longer maintained: 11.2.0\\n\\nJanuary 20, 2017\\n\\n2017-08-01\\n\\nBlueStore is stable, EC for RBD pools\\n\\nLuminous\\n\\nOld version, no longer maintained: 12.2.0\\n\\nAugust 29, 2017\\n\\n2020-03-01\\n\\npg-upmap balancer\\n\\nMimic\\n\\nOld version, no longer maintained: 13.2.0\\n\\nJune 1, 2018\\n\\n2020-07-22\\n\\nsnapshots are stable, Beast is stable\\n\\nNautilus\\n\\nOld version, no longer maintained: 14.2.0\\n\\nMarch 19, 2019\\n\\n2021-06-01\\n\\nasynchronous replication, auto-retry of failed writes due to grown defect remapping\\n\\nOctopus\\n\\nOld version, no longer maintained: 15.2.0\\n\\nMarch 23, 2020\\n\\n2022-06-01\\n\\nPacific\\n\\nOlder version, yet still maintained: 16.2.0\\n\\nMarch 31, 2021[47]\\n\\n2023-06-01\\n\\nQuincy\\n\\nCurrent stable version: 17.2.0\\n\\nApril 19, 2022[48]\\n\\n2024-06-01\\n\\nauto-setting of min_alloc_size for novel media\\n\\nReef[49]\\n\\nFuture release: TBA\\n\\nTBA\\n\\nSquid\\n\\nFuture release: TBA\\n\\nTBA\\n\\nLegend:\\n\\nOld version\\n\\nOlder version, still maintained\\n\\nLatest version\\n\\nLatest preview version\\n\\nFuture release\\n\\nAvailable platforms[edit]\\n\\nWindows Server 2016 (some commands might be unavailable due to lack of\\n\\nUNIX socket implementation),\\n\\nWindows Server 2019 and\\n\\nWindows Server 2022, but testing/development can be done also on\\n\\nWindows 10 and\\n\\nWindows 11.

The idea is to have a set of text boxes that will get blurred and scaled down once we hover over them. The item in focus will scale up. This will create some kind of “focus” effect that drwas the attention to the currently hovered item.\\n\\nWe’ll be using CSS3 transitions and some jQuery to apply the respective classes. Since CSS3 transitions are not supported in order browsers, the demo should be best viewed in Safari or Chrome (here we got the smoothest transitions).\\n\\nSince we will be using transitions, this effect will only work properly in browsers that support them.\\n\\nSo let’s start!\\n\\nThe Markup\\n\\nThe structure will be a section with some articles in i. Each article item will have a header and a paragraph:\\n\\nLet’s look at the style.\\n\\nThe CSS\\n\\nThe main container will be of fixed width and centered:\\n\\nLet’s clear the floats (out articles will be floating) with the help of the :before and :after pseudo elements:\\n\\nNow, let’s style the article items. We’ll make them float and add two box shadows, of which the white one will have a large spread distance. Also, we’ll add the transition for three properties: opacity, transform (we want to scale it) and box-shadow:\\n\\nFor Webkit browsers we’ll also add\\n\\nto avoid a short flicker. (You can remove this if you prefer to have a crisp looking text, though).\\n\\nLet’s style the text elements and create some nice typography. The color and the text-shadow of each element will be matching:\\n\\nAnd now we’ll add the transition to all three. Again, we’ll have three properties: opacity, text-shadow and color:\\n\\nThe blur class will be applied to all the siblings of the currently hovered item. We want to scale them down a bit and add a big white box shadow, to make the box look blurry. We’ll also decrease the opacity a bit:\\n\\nIn order to make the text elements look blurry, we’ll make the color transparent by setting the opacity of the rgba value to 0, and  we’ll enlarge the text-shadow blur distance:\\n\\nThe currently hovered item will be slightly enlarged and adjust the box shadow. We’ll also set a high z.index to guarantee that the item will always be on top of the other ones when we hover over it:\\n\\nLast, but not least, we’ll set the opacity of the text elements to 1:\\n\\nAnd that’s all the style! Let’s have a look at the JavaScript.\\n\\nThe JavaScript\\n\\nSo, when we hover over an article, we will give all the other articles the class blur and the current one will receive the class active:\\n\\nAnd that’s all!

Yes, it’s because of the -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden property. You can remove it and see if you like the effect more, it will be more sharp, but while sharpening up there is a slight “jump”. That’s why I actually used it in the first place, but you are right, I guess a sharper text is much more important 🙂\\nCheers and thanks, ML\\n\\nnice job ML\\n\\nBeben Koben December 14, 2011 at 18:59\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSo blurry…i think my eyes is blurred +_+ 😛\\nKreatip.\\n\\nNice use of HTML5 selectors!\\n\\nGrafics December 14, 2011 at 20:26\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt’s very beautiful…\\n\\nCan’t help but already fall in love with your works.

Its main purpose is to help you decide which fallback styles and or polyfill scripts you want to use when a certain feature (e.g. multiple backgrounds in css) is not supported.\\n\\nPrayag Verma December 17, 2011 at 15:51\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe effect is awesome, but why didn’t you use :hover alone on the items to be activated and the rest of them be blurred by using the nth-of-type css3 selector\\n\\n@ERWIN HEISER\\nThank you for your answer, I was confused about what Modernizr could get, I thought it was capable to achieve some modern CSS tecniques through JS.\\n\\nZaorish December 23, 2011 at 03:48\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnice, very nice)\\nand for images:\\n.ib-container article.blur img{\\nfilter:blur(Add=1,Direction=1,Strength=7); /* IE6-8 */\\n-webkit-filter: blur(7px); /* chrome, safari */\\n/* -moz-filter? */\\n/* -o-filter? */\\n}\\n🙂\\n\\nBummer that it doesn’t work in IE.

The module first performs a check to see if the target is WD MyCloud. If so, it attempts to trigger an authentication bypass (CVE-2018-17153) via a crafted GET request to /cgi-bin/network_mgr.cgi. If the server responds as expected, the module assesses the vulnerability status by attempting to exploit a commend injection vulnerability (CVE-2016-10108) in order to print a random string via the echo command. This is done via a crafted POST request to /web/google_analytics.php. If the server is vulnerable, the same command injection vector is leveraged to execute the payload. This module has been successfully tested against Western Digital MyCloud version 2.30.183.\\n\\ntags | exploit, remote, web, cgi, root, php, vulnerability, code execution\\n\\nDownload  | Favorite | View\\n\\nJoomla Solidres 2.13.3 Cross Site Scripting\\n\\nPosted Jul 28, 2023\\n\\nAuthored by CraCkEr\\n\\nJoomla Solidres extension version 2.13.3 suffers from a cross site scripting vulnerability.\\n\\ntags | exploit, xss\\n\\nDownload  | Favorite | View\\n\\nRed Hat Security Advisory 2023-4313-01\\n\\nPosted Jul 28, 2023\\n\\nAuthored by Red Hat | Site access.redhat.com\\n\\nRed Hat Security Advisory 2023-4313-01 - PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system.\\n\\ntags | advisory\\n\\nsystems | linux, redhat\\n\\nDownload  | Favorite | View\\n\\nUbuntu Security Notice USN-6259-1\\n\\nPosted Jul 27, 2023\\n\\nAuthored by Ubuntu | Site security.ubuntu.com\\n\\nUbuntu Security Notice 6259-1 - Jos Wetzels, Stanislav Dashevskyi, and Amine Amri discovered that Open-iSCSI incorrectly handled certain checksums for IP packets.

Hacker Newsletter today had a pretty good article https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-year-2/I\\'m mostly looking for something similar since this kind of blog post can give some good insights.Thanks.    \\n                  \\n          \\n          enriquto on Feb 8, 2020           \\n             | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  I follow regularly these people, these are mostly slow-going blogs or websites:1. Fabrice Bellard: https://bellard.org/  This is not really a blog, but a traditional website with links to the work of its author (who is probably one of the top programmers ever).  It updates rarely, but when it does, it is to expose yet another monumental piece of computing work that will blow your universe.2. Linus Akesson: https://www.linusakesson.net/  He\\'s always onto some funny crazy things: obfuscated programming, underhanded programming, c64 emulation, chiptunes...3. Uriel l\\'Étranger: http://cat-v.org/  The only self-described \"philosopher of software\" that I have ever seen.  His website is of course not updated anymore, but you can re-read it many times and always learn something new.4. Ted Unangst: https://flak.tedunangst.com/ Nice to follow some cool news about openbsd development5. Andy Chu: http://www.oilshell.org/blog/  Who has embarked in an amazing quest to turn the unix shell into a cleaner tool6.

See, e.g., how to do a select query in SQL. Good to know, for sure, and helpful if you\\'re unfamiliar with SQL, but definitely really basic. Love the drawings though, and I could see if I were just getting into being an SWE or aspired to be one, they could be a good starting point.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          icebraining on Feb 8, 2020           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  They\\'re for an entry level audience, but not just for aspiring SWEs.

In that way, I can compare and contrast these various technology stacks. I blog about the results here.http://glennengstrand.infoSo far, I have covered clojure on ring, scala on finatra, java on dropwizard, javascript on node, python on flask, scala on scalatra, java on spring boot, go, and typescript on apollo (graphql).\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          0x445442 on Feb 8, 2020           \\n             | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Great idea for a blog! Is there any reason you have not ventured into the serverless realm? It would be interesting to hear the take on that ecosystem from someone who has such experience with microservice stacks.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          gengstrand on Feb 8, 2020           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  That is a great question. You are absolutely correct. I try to evaluate open source technology stacks that are emerging. I do feel like there is growing interest in serverless computing but most companies end up going with AWS Lambda which is not open source. I was wondering if the folks here are considering open source serverless technologies. If so, then which ones are making your short list?\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          0x445442 on Feb 9, 2020           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Maybe https://www.openfaas.com/\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                                    \\n          \\n          SyneRyder on Feb 8, 2020           \\n             | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Cliffski\\'s blog is one of the only ones I follow that is still active.

Instead of success, Steve\\'s story is of one who dropped out of the college at 19 and had to sleep in his car for while.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          lucasfdacunha on Feb 8, 2020           \\n             | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Do you have the link to those that you\\'ve mentioned?\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          yori on Feb 8, 2020           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Really easy to find with a quick search:https://www.joelonsoftware.com/http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                              \\n          \\n          koenigdavidmj on Feb 8, 2020           \\n             | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Joey Hess: http://joeyh.name/Lives out in the sticks and codes embedded stuff in Haskell, usually to automate his life in the backwoods of East Tennessee.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          mark_l_watson on Feb 8, 2020           \\n             | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Thanks for posting that.

Eric Buijs: http://homehack.nl/Eric Buijs about himself:[0]> I’m an privacy, free/libre software, open data and open standards advocate. I’m holding a grudge against Big Tech, big IP holders and authoritharian governments. Furthermore I’m a 3D designer, 3D printer, webdesigner and overall DIY guy. But most of all I’m a free man.> In addition I\\'m also a bicycle enthusiast. The bicycle is one of the most energy efficient ways of transportation and as far as I\\'m concerned the most fun way. On top of that riding a bicycle is an excellent way to lose weight, increase strenght and improve overall health. Now get on your bicycle and have fun.[0] https://fosstodon.org/@ericbuijs[1] https://homehack.nl/about/\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                        \\n          \\n          bullen on Feb 8, 2020           \\n             | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  I\\'m trying to get a forum about MMO development started by posting to my own blog from here: http://reddit.com/r/mmodev\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                  \\n          \\n          sillycube on Feb 8, 2020           \\n             | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Solo developers are too busy with the business.

In Part III, we will start interacting with client windows and the user through events. We will review the fundamentals of window manager implementation, using the implementation in our example non-compositing reparenting window manager, basic_wm, for reference.\\n\\nStep 4: Interaction with Application Windows\\n\\nFollowing the steps in Part II of this series, we now have a basic skeleton for our window manager. Our next step is to start talking to clients and the user via events.\\n\\nThe interaction between clients, X, and the window manager is fairly complex. To facilitate our discussion, I’ve created a diagram that illustrates the flow of events throughout the lifetime of a client window, and how a window manager might respond to each of them. We’ll be referring to this cheat sheet for window manager event handling throughout this series. You can click through for the full-sized diagram.\\n\\nIn general, a window manager must handle two kinds of actions: those initiated by client applications (such as creating new windows), and those initiated by users (such as moving or minimizing windows). In this diagram, actions initiated by client applications are shown in the yellow box on the left hand side, and actions initiated by users are shown in blue on the right hand side. A window manager communicates with client applications via events, which are represented as parallelograms in red.\\n\\nYou may have noticed that some of the events in this diagram have the suffix Request, while others have the suffix Notify. This distinction is crucial to our discussion.\\n\\nRecalling our discussion in Part I on substructure redirection, when a client application wants to do something with a window (such as moving, resizing, showing, or hiding), its request is redirected to the window manager, which can grant, modify, or deny the request. Such requests are delivered to a window manager as events with the Request suffix. It is important to understand that when a window manager receives such an event, the action it represents has not actually occurred, and it is the responsibility of the window manager to decide what to do with it. If the window manager does nothing, the request is implicitly denied.\\n\\nOn the other hand, events with the Notify suffix represent actions that have already been executed by the X server. The window manager can respond to such events, but of course cannot change the fact that they have already happened.\\n\\nWith that in mind, let’s dive into the implementation by looking at how our example window manager will handle the life cycle of a client window from creation to destruction.\\n\\nCreating a Window\\n\\nWhen an X client application creates a top-level window (XCreateWindow()), our window manager will receive a CreateNotify event. However, a newly created window is always invisible, so there’s nothing for our window manager to do. In window_manager.cpp:\\n\\nvoid WindowManager::Run() {\\n  ...\\n\\n// 2. Main event loop.\\n\\nfor (;;) {\\n\\n// 1. Get next event.\\n    ...\\n\\n// 2. Dispatch event.\\n\\nswitch (e.type) {\\n      ...\\n\\ncase CreateNotify:\\n        OnCreateNotify(e.xcreatewindow);\\n\\nbreak;\\n      ...\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nvoid WindowManager::OnCreateNotify(\\n\\nconst XCreateWindowEvent& e) {}\\n\\nConfiguring a Newly Created Window\\n\\nAt this stage, the application can configure the window to set its initial size, position, or other attributes. To do so, the application would invoke XConfigureWindow(), which would send a ConfigureRequest event to the window manager. However, since the window is still invisible, the window manager doesn’t need to care and can grant such requests without modification by invoking XConfigureWindow() itself with the same parameters.\\n\\nvoid WindowManager::Run() {\\n      ...\\n\\ncase ConfigureRequest:\\n        OnConfigureRequest(e.xconfigurerequest);\\n\\nbreak;\\n      ...\\n}\\n\\nvoid WindowManager::OnConfigureRequest(\\n\\nconst XConfigureRequestEvent& e) {\\n  XWindowChanges changes;\\n\\n// Copy fields from e to changes.\\n  changes.x = e.x;\\n  changes.y = e.y;\\n  changes.width = e.width;\\n  changes.height = e.height;\\n  changes.border_width = e.border_width;\\n  changes.sibling = e.above;\\n  changes.stack_mode = e.detail;\\n\\n// Grant request by calling XConfigureWindow().\\n  XConfigureWindow(display_, e.window, e.value_mask, &changes);\\n  LOG(INFO) <<\\n\\n\"Resize \" << e.window <<\\n\\n\" to \" << Size<\\n\\nint>(e.width, e.height);\\n}\\n\\nMapping a Window\\n\\nTo make the window finally visible on screen, the client application will call XMapWindow() to map it. This sends a MapRequest event to the window manager. As noted earlier, at this point, the window is still not yet visible, as it’s up to the window manager to actually make it so. This is probably the most important event in our discussion, as this is where a window manager would usually start really managing a window.\\n\\nA reparenting window manager would typically respond to a MapRequest for a client application window w with the following actions:\\n\\nCreate a frame window f, perhaps with borders and window decoration (e.g. title, minimize / maximize / close buttons).\\n\\nRegister for substructure redirect on f with XSelectInput(). Recall that substructure redirect only applies to direct child windows, so after reparenting, the substructure redirect previously registered on the root window would no longer apply to w, hence this step.\\n\\nMake w a child of f with XReparentWindow().\\n\\nRender f and w with XMapWindow().\\n\\nRegister for mouse or keyboard shortcuts on w and/or f.\\n\\nThe example implementation in basic_wm will create a very simple frame window that has the same size as the client window, but with a 3px red border:\\n\\nvoid WindowManager::Run() {\\n      ...\\n\\ncase MapRequest:\\n        OnMapRequest(e.xmaprequest);\\n\\nbreak;\\n      ...\\n}\\n\\nvoid WindowManager::OnMapRequest(\\n\\nconst XMapRequestEvent& e) {\\n\\n// 1. Frame or re-frame window.\\n  Frame(e.window);\\n\\n// 2.

TODO - see Framing Existing Top-Level Windows section below.\\n\\n// 3. Create frame.\\n\\nconst Window frame = XCreateSimpleWindow(\\n      display_,\\n      root_,\\n      x_window_attrs.x,\\n      x_window_attrs.y,\\n      x_window_attrs.width,\\n      x_window_attrs.height,\\n      BORDER_WIDTH,\\n      BORDER_COLOR,\\n      BG_COLOR);\\n\\n// 3.

Switch windows with alt + tab.\\n  XGrabKey(...);\\n\\n  LOG(INFO) <<\\n\\n\"Framed window \" << w <<\\n\\n\" [\" << frame <<\\n\\n\"]\";\\n}\\n\\nThe outline of the code should be fairly clear following our discussion. A few additional points to note:\\n\\nRegarding the save-set and XAddToSaveSet():\\n\\nThe save-set is a list of windows, usually maintained by the window manager, but including only windows created by other clients. If the window manager dies, all windows listed in the save-set will be reparented back to their closest living ancestor if they were reparented in the first place and mapped if the window manager has unmapped them so that it could map an icon.\\nThe save-set is necessary because the window manager might not exit normally. The user might kill it with CTRL-C if it is running in the foreground, or more likely, the user might get the process number and kill it. Actually, the actions of the save-set are performed even if the window manager exits normally, so less code is needed since the save-set does the cleaning up.\\nWindow managers almost always place in the save-set all the windows they reparent or iconify, using XAddToSaveSet().\\nWindows are automatically removed from the save-set when they are destroyed.\\n—  Xlib Programming Manual §16.4\\n\\nWhen our window manager creates a frame window (step 2 in the example code), it will also trigger a CreateNotify event for the frame window. It will ignore it just like it ignores other CreateNotify events as discussed earlier.\\n\\nWhen our window manager calls XReparentWindow() in step 5 in the example code, it will trigger a ReparentNotify event, which it will ignore:\\nvoid WindowManager::Run() {\\n      ...\\n      case ReparentNotify:\\n        OnReparentNotify(e.xreparent);\\n        break;\\n      ...\\n}\\n\\nvoid WindowManager::OnReparentNotify(const XReparentEvent& e) {}\\n\\nWhen our window manager calls XMapWindow() to map the frame window (step 6 in the example code), the X server knows that the action originates from the current window manager, and will execute it directly instead of redirecting it back as a MapRequest event. Our window manager will later receive a MapNotify event, which it can ignore:\\nvoid WindowManager::Run() {\\n      ...\\n      case MapNotify:\\n        OnMapNotify(e.xmap);\\n        break;\\n      ...\\n}\\n\\nvoid WindowManager::OnMapNotify(const XMapEvent& e) {}\\n\\nConfiguring a Mapped Window\\n\\nA client application can configure a window that is currently visible, again with the XConfigureWindow() function. For example, an application may want to resize a window to better accomodate its contents. When a reparenting window manager receives the resulting ConfigureRequest and decides to grant the request, it additionally needs to resize / reposition the corresponding frame window and any window decorations.\\n\\nvoid WindowManager::OnConfigureRequest(\\n\\nconst XConfigureRequestEvent& e) {\\n  XWindowChanges changes;\\n\\n// Copy fields from e to changes.\\n  ...\\n\\nif (clients_.count(e.window)) {\\n\\nconst Window frame = clients_[e.window];\\n    XConfigureWindow(display_, frame, e.value_mask, &changes);\\n    LOG(INFO) <<\\n\\n\"Resize [\" << frame <<\\n\\n\"] to \" << Size<\\n\\nint>(e.width, e.height);\\n  }\\n\\n// Grant request by calling XConfigureWindow().\\n  ...\\n}\\n\\nWhen our window manager re-configures the frame window with the XConfigureWindow() call above, the X server knows that the action originates from the current window manager, and will execute it directly instead of redirecting it back as a ConfigureRequest event. Our window manager will then receive a ConfigureNotify event, which it will ignore:\\n\\nvoid WindowManager::Run() {\\n      ...\\n\\ncase ConfigureNotify:\\n        OnConfigureNotify(e.xconfigure);\\n\\nbreak;\\n      ...\\n}\\n\\nvoid WindowManager::OnConfigureNotify(\\n\\nconst XConfigureEvent& e) {}\\n\\nUnmapping a Window\\n\\nWhen a client application unmaps (i.e. hides) a window with XUnmapWindow(), for example in response to the user exiting or minimizing the application, the window manager will receive a UnmapNotify event. Unlike the MapRequest event, the UnmapNotify event is delivered to the window manager after the fact, and the window manager can only respond to it, not intercept it.\\n\\nA reparenting window manager will typically want to reverse the actions it performed in response to MapRequest. In other words, it would reparent the client window back to the root window, and destroy the corresponding frame window.\\n\\nvoid WindowManager::Run() {\\n      ...\\n\\ncase UnmapNotify:\\n        OnUnmapNotify(e.xunmap);\\n\\nbreak;\\n      ...\\n}\\n\\nvoid WindowManager::OnUnmapNotify(\\n\\nconst XUnmapEvent& e) {\\n\\n// If the window is a client window we manage, unframe it upon UnmapNotify. We\\n\\n// need the check because we will receive an UnmapNotify event for a frame\\n\\n// window we just destroyed ourselves.\\n\\nif (!clients_.count(e.window)) {\\n    LOG(INFO) <<\\n\\n\"Ignore UnmapNotify for non-client window \" << e.window;\\n\\nreturn;\\n  }\\n\\n  Unframe(e.window);\\n}\\n\\nvoid WindowManager::Unframe(Window w) {\\n\\n// We reverse the steps taken in Frame().\\n\\nconst Window frame = clients_[w];\\n\\n// 1. Unmap frame.\\n  XUnmapWindow(display_, frame);\\n\\n// 2. Reparent client window back to root window.\\n  XReparentWindow(\\n      display_,\\n      w,\\n      root_,\\n\\n0,\\n\\n0);\\n\\n// Offset of client window within root.\\n\\n// 3. Remove client window from save set, as it is now unrelated to us.\\n  XRemoveFromSaveSet(display_, w);\\n\\n// 4. Destroy frame.\\n  XDestroyWindow(display_, frame);\\n\\n// 5. Drop reference to frame handle.\\n  clients_.erase(w);\\n\\n  LOG(INFO) <<\\n\\n\"Unframed window \" << w <<\\n\\n\" [\" << frame <<\\n\\n\"]\";\\n}\\n\\nA few additional points to note:\\n\\nWhen our window manager unmaps the frame window with XUnmapWindow() in step 1 in the example code above, it will again receive a corresponding UnmapNotify event. This is the reason why the UnmapNotify event handler needs to check that the unmapped window is an actual client window.\\n\\nWhen our window manager makes the client window a direct child of the root window with XReparentWindow() in step 2 above, it will receive a ReparentNotify event. As discussed in the Mapping a Window section above, this ReparentNotify event will be ignored.\\n\\nWhen our window manager destroys the frame window with XDestroyWindow() in step 4, it will trigger a DestroyNotify event. This event will also be ignored, as shown in the next section.\\n\\nAt this point, the client window has become invisible, but not yet destroyed. It can be displayed again with a call to XMapWindow(), which would take us back to the Mapping a Window step. It could also be reconfigured in this state, which would take us back to the Configuring a Newly Created Window step.\\n\\nDestroying a Window\\n\\nWhen a client application exits or no longer needs a window, it will call XDestroyWindow() to dispose of the window. This triggers a DestroyNotify event. In our case, there’s nothing we need to do in response.\\n\\nvoid WindowManager::Run() {\\n      ...\\n\\ncase DestroyNotify:\\n        OnDestroyNotify(e.xdestroywindow);\\n\\nbreak;\\n      ...\\n}\\n\\nvoid WindowManager::OnDestroyNotify(\\n\\nconst XDestroyWindowEvent& e) {}\\n\\nFraming Existing Top-Level Windows\\n\\nNow that we’ve walked through the life cycle of a client window, from creation to destruction, let’s turn our attention to the problem of existing top-level windows.\\n\\nYou may recall from Part I that X applications in general run just fine without a window manager. Depending on how an X session is started (e.g. xinitrc), by the time a window manager starts, any number of windows may have already been created by other applications. Additionally, the user can kill a running window manager and replace it with a different window manager, without affecting windows from other applications.\\n\\nTherefore, when our window manager starts up, it needs to handle any existing top-level windows that are already mapped. As a reparenting window manager, it will invoke the same Frame() function on such windows as if these windows are being mapped for the first time:\\n\\nvoid WindowManager::Run() {\\n\\n// 1. Initialization.\\n\\n//   a. Select events on root window. Use a special error handler so we can\\n\\n//   exit gracefully if another window manager is already running.\\n  ...\\n\\n//   b. Set error handler.\\n  ...\\n\\n//   c. Grab X server to prevent windows from changing under us while we\\n\\n//   frame them.\\n  XGrabServer(display_);\\n\\n//   d. Frame existing top-level windows.\\n\\n//     i. Query existing top-level windows.\\n  Window returned_root, returned_parent;\\n  Window* top_level_windows;\\n\\nunsigned\\n\\nint num_top_level_windows;\\n  CHECK(XQueryTree(\\n      display_,\\n      root_,\\n      &returned_root,\\n      &returned_parent,\\n      &top_level_windows,\\n      &num_top_level_windows));\\n  CHECK_EQ(returned_root, root_);\\n\\n//     ii. Frame each top-level window.\\n\\nfor (\\n\\nunsigned\\n\\nint i =\\n\\n0; i < num_top_level_windows; ++i) {\\n    Frame(top_level_windows[i],\\n\\ntrue\\n\\n/* was_created_before_window_manager */);\\n  }\\n\\n//     iii. Free top-level window array.\\n  XFree(top_level_windows);\\n\\n//   e. Ungrab X server.\\n  XUngrabServer(display_);\\n\\n// 2. Main event loop.\\n  ...\\n}\\n\\nvoid WindowManager::OnMapRequest(\\n\\nconst XMapRequestEvent& e) {\\n\\n// 1. Frame or re-frame window.\\n  Frame(e.window,\\n\\nfalse\\n\\n/* was_created_before_window_manager */);\\n  ...\\n}\\n\\nvoid WindowManager::Frame(Window w,\\n\\nbool was_created_before_window_manager) {\\n  ...\\n\\n// 1. Retrieve attributes of window to frame.\\n  ...\\n\\n// 2. If window was created before window manager started, we should frame\\n\\n// it only if it is visible and doesn\\'t set override_redirect.\\n\\nif (was_created_before_window_manager) {\\n\\nif (x_window_attrs.override_redirect ||\\n        x_window_attrs.map_state != IsViewable) {\\n\\nreturn;\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n// 3. Create frame.\\n  ...\\n}\\n\\nvoid WindowManager::OnUnmapNotify(\\n\\nconst XUnmapEvent& e) {\\n  ...\\n\\n// Ignore event if it is triggered by reparenting a window that was mapped\\n\\n// before the window manager started.\\n\\n//\\n\\n// Since we receive UnmapNotify events from the SubstructureNotify mask, the\\n\\n// event attribute specifies the parent window of the window that was\\n\\n// unmapped. This means that an UnmapNotify event from a normal client window\\n\\n// should have this attribute set to a frame window we maintain. Only an\\n\\n// UnmapNotify event triggered by reparenting a pre-existing window will have\\n\\n// this attribute set to the root window.\\n\\nif (e.event == root_) {\\n    LOG(INFO) <<\\n\\n\"Ignore UnmapNotify for reparented pre-existing window \"\\n              << e.window;\\n\\nreturn;\\n  }\\n\\n  Unframe(e.window);\\n}\\n\\nSome additional things to note:\\n\\nYou may notice that the process of framing existing top-level windows is guarded by XGrabServer() and XUngrabServer(). From the Xlib Programming Manual:\\n\\nThese functions can be used to control processing of output on other connections by the window system server. While the server is grabbed, no processing of requests or close downs on any other connection will occur.\\n—  Xlib Programming Manual §9.5\\n\\nBy grabbing the X server, our window manager ensures that, between the time when it fetches the list of existing top-level windows and when it finishes framing them, no other application can interfere and mess up our state: no new windows can be created, and no existing windows can be modified or destroyed.\\n\\nThe override_redirect attribute, if set to true, indicates that a window should not be managed by window managers. From the Xlib Programming Manual:\\n\\nTo control window placement or to add decoration, a window manager often needs to intercept (redirect) any map or configure request. Pop-up windows, however, often need to be mapped without a window manager getting in the way. […]\\nThe override-redirect flag specifies whether map and configure requests on this window should override a SubstructureRedirectMask on the parent. You can set the override-redirect flag to True or False (default). Window managers use this information to avoid tampering with pop-up windows […].\\n—  Xlib Programming Manual §3.2.8\\n\\nThe reason our window manager doesn’t need to check for this attribute except at start up is that the X server knows not to redirect events from such windows:\\n\\nThe window manager […] will normally ignore windows that are mapped with their override_redirect attribute set, since no *Request events will be generated for them.\\n—  Xlib Programming Manual §16.3\\n\\nThe map_state attribute indicates whether a window is currently visible (mapped). When Frame() is invoked for pre-existing windows during start up, we want to ignore windows that are currently unmapped. However, when Frame() is invoked during the event loop as part of the MapRequest handler, we know that the client window to be framed is necessarily still unmapped, as our window manager wouldn’t have granted the request yet.\\n\\nYou might be wondering why an additional check for e.event == root_ is needed in the UnmapNotify handler. It turns out that reparenting an already mapped window (XReparentWindow()) will trigger a pair of UnmapNotify and MapNotify events in addition to ReparentNotify. Therefore, when we enter into the event loop, we will receive an UnmapNotify event for every pre-existing top-level window we reparented. We can distinguish these events by their event attribute, which in this case represents the parent of the client window. Normally, when a client window we already framed is unmapped, the event attribute would be its frame window. But when a pre-existing window is reparented at start up, the event attribute in the resulting UnmapNotify event will be its original parent - i.e., the root window.\\n\\nWhat’s Next\\n\\nAt this point, we have a basic but functional reparenting window manager that will correctly handle the life cycle of windows. If you strip out window decorations, shortcuts and fancy UI, the core structure of every X window manager will quite closely resemble what we have here.\\n\\nIn our next installment, we will improve the user-facing functionality of our window manager by adding ways to move, resize and close windows. In the meantime, you’re more than welcome to check out the code for basic_wm on GitHub.\\n\\nPart I: Basic Concepts\\n\\nPart II: Introduction, Setup & Teardown, Initialization, Event Loop\\n\\nPart

That alone was worth it. I could never run anything that looks like such a conceptual pain the butt. A pain to maintain and troubleshoot to boot.Especially since the setup requires a Raspberry Pi to run permanently. A Raspberry Pi that itself would work just as fine as the Time Machine server the author seems to need on demand?\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          aequitas 3 months ago           \\n             | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  I agree, but you could argue that the Raspberry Pi is not performant enough during restores or browsing the backups. During the backup itself performance should not have to be that big of an issue as it\\'s mostly a background operation you will not be waiting on.You could also use the RPi as a stepping stone which syncs it\\'s files to the \\'real\\' backup server which is on a daily/weekly timer instead of on-demand setup.I\\'m using this concept for the problem that I want to collect metrics all day long, but not have a power hungry server running 24/7. So my RPi collects all metrics and streams then directly to my server for me to view realtime. But whenever the server is unavailable (on schedule or for maintenance) the RPi just buffers the metrics until the server is available again.Also worth considering is just not using a single server for a single purpose but just cramming it full with utility to justify the power costs.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          jeffbee 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  > power hungry server running 24/7Nothing in this article supports this statement. It just says \"high power consumption\" without measuring, and declares victory without measuring the power saved. The fact is that power scaling has almost erased the difference between \"suspended\" and just \"idle\", to such an extent that there might not even be a meaningful difference, or any measurable difference.My NUC 12 Pro is drawing, at the wall, 2.7W, as best as I can measure. The SoC reports drawing below 200mW. This server is on. The way to get low power states on these is to just make sure your Linux is up to the task and your BIOS works correctly, which is one of the reasons to choose a NUC. The first-party firmware works!Another important thing for low-power server operation is to either use wifi, or make sure your ethernet is configured correctly for low-power operation. Unless you fix it, gigabit ethernet by default will propagate the link state all the way down to a high power state on the CPU. The NIC will say that it has tight latency requirements because the link is active, and it will configure the PCIe bus to avoid PCI link power management, and it will tell the CPU that it can\\'t go below PC6. To avoid this you have to configure your NIC to ignore link latency requirements. Just unplugging the ethernet is the easier path, and it\\'s faster than gigabit these days.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          dekhn 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  NOte that the NUCs with power saving and wifi have a serious problem: latency.  By default in the various Linux OSen I use, wifi power management is enabled.  Often times, repeated pings will jump from 5ms to 100+ms (with a very high variance) and network bandwidth will be extremely poor.  Even ssh on a LAN can be unusable!\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          jeffbee 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Sure, but it\\'s a miracle that it can do this at all. It\\'s entering and exiting a sleep state that is very nearly off, in between pings.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                        \\n          \\n          ape4 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  My first thought too.  Reports can show the power usage for each process.  So reduce the power-hungry processes.  Or schedule them for lower cost times of day.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                        \\n          \\n          manmal 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Then how about an N95/N100 (recent Celeron successor) mini PC, like the ones from Beelink? They don’t draw that much power, but are 2-3x faster than a Raspi, have HW supported video de/encoding and can even run Windows if you needed that.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          DJBunnies 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  \"that much power\" is pretty subjective, is it 2x or 10x a pi?

I haven\\'t measured power draw of the whole system yet though, I imagine that the mainboard will pull another couple watts at least.It shines especially in scenarios where the Pi is just a tad too slow. E.g. you can\\'t live transcode 4k videos on a Pi, while the N100 has latest UHD graphics and therefore ships with a decent HW-accelerated H265 en/decoder.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          nottorp 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  There are a lot of low power media boxes but few servers sadly.By server i mean multiple network ports and storage ports, space in the case for several spinny discs in addition to the ssds etc.I doubt any NUC is good for a server by my definition.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          gh02t 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Sure there are, there are lots of NAS appliances boxes from the likes of Synology/QNAP/Aliexpress Special that can run double duty as servers built on similar low power CPUs. Some of them even have decent networking options.The problem is that a lot of the commercial products are woefully underspecc\\'ed for the price and you outgrow them quickly. Spinning disks also eat a lot of power, relatively speaking, so they kind of eat into the \"low power\" usecase.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          nottorp 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  > lots of NAS appliances boxesRather roll my own Linux thank you.> Some of them even have decent networking options.I think few of them have multiple ethernet ports. Plus there\\'s the matter of how much cpu the built in ethernet eats.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          gh02t 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  You should actually look at what\\'s available. You can get a QNAP box with an ARM CPU with lots of drive slots, dual 2.5 gig Ethernet and dual 10 gig SFP+ for like $700, among many more examples. Sure saturating those is gonna eat a ton of cycles and run like shit but... yeah of course it is it\\'s a cheap low power CPU. They suck for the sorts of stuff I wanna do, but this is inherently a market segment that involves compromise and that is probably perfect for some people.I agree I\\'d much rather roll my own system (and that\\'s what I did) and I would personally never buy one of those, but it\\'s simply not right to say there are no options available if you want a low power server off the shelf. Some of them are even decent if you wanna pay for it.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                  \\n          \\n          manmal 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  > Rather roll my own Linux thank you.Most modern NAS have that option.

Good news! There\\'s ChatGPT now!It\\'s so much quicker than google for figuring out approaches; it\\'s great for explaining concepts and \"how to do x with tech\". And it\\'s great at writing the scripts for you too.  I set up a prometheus/grafana dashboard with scripts for various temperatures from various APIs with its help.Not trying to shill, but just sharing that this type of project is something that\\'s a lot more feasible to implement in limited timeframes than it used to be.

Of the info that exists most is inconsistent, outdated, and/or wrong. The specific instructions need to depend on what\\'s supported by the exact model number of your network card. You\\'re dealing with hardware, so there\\'s a chance of breaking things permanently. Close has zero value, the solution needs to be exactly right. Close but incorrect solutions are hard to debug.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          gertlex 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  I didn\\'t in-depth read the main article here.

I\\'ve messed with Wake-on-Lan stuff in the past, as well as \"prevent device from randomly waking from sleep\" issues, too (on Windows, though).I do have the advantage of a lot of past experience with Atmegas then RPis, so know a lot of the common sense hardware considerations... and a lot of troubleshooting.  For me getting 90% correct with ChatGPT, and building up incrementally, has been an improvement on doing it all myself with google.I might take an attempt at asking chatGPT how to do what the author did. Could be informative, even if just introspective realizations like, \"oh, this is a question I asked in a good way due to my existing knowledge.\"\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                        \\n          \\n          monocasa 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  So far my experience has been the opposite with ChapGPT FWIW.

It would be easy to blame the pi or Linux, but as far as I can tell, Apple just does not play nicely with anything not Apple. It\\'s just that little bit different.

Mostly because it supports full snapshots, with an easy way to get the difference between two snapshots.The previous HFS+ version relied on directory hardlinks that were notoriously buggy and easy to corrupt. The difference computation also required basically recursively walking the entire tree and comparing the directory change times, with each lookup requiring a network round-trip.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                  \\n          \\n          jdminhbg 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  I had the exact same problem and ended up with the same solution.

Zero issue.I\\'ve got another one constantly establishing a remote SSH-tunnel so that I can easily troubleshoot my brother, who lives in another country, \\'s LAN. The uptime is more than a year.One is routing (well, doing SNAT really) and firewalling between two non routable LANs.  I set up the thing once and it\\'s so reliable there\\'s neither a screen nor a monitor hooked to it: just the power adapter and two ethernet cables (including one in a USB-to-ethernet adapter).Another one is running unbound.  Same: no monitor, no keyboard, no nothing.  The power adapter and one ethernet cable.  Simple.  Not much can go wrong.  No moving parts.  It\\'s happily null routing hundreds of thousands of crappy domain names 24/7.I\\'ve got another one in a vintage arcade cab with a Pi2JAMMA adapter.  In years it never failed to boot once.  As we the others, just in case, I still have a \"dd\" of the entire SD card.  Should something happen I\\'d just dd the image to a new SD card.The shortage of RPi is apparently due to companies snapping them all for industrial uses.I haven\\'t heard of many people complaining \"my RPi died overnight\" (unlike, say, the Apple M1 laptop\\'s screens).They\\'re incredibly reliable pieces of equipment for their gentle price.  In case something goes wrong on one of mine, I just have a dump of the entire SD card.I don\\'t disagree that they may be a pain in the butt to set up, just like any server.  But once setup, they don\\'t move under your feet so the maintenance is really minimal.I hate that there\\'s a shortage of Pi but I\\'m not sure that criticizing them as \"non reliable\" is a criticism made in good faith.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          JosephRedfern 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  I\\'m not sure OP was necessarily implying that the Pi specifically wasn\\'t suitable for the job -- perhaps just that requiring /any/ other additional computer to achieve this is not without additional administrative overhead and power costs.It does seems likely that a Pi is going to consume a fair bit less energy than the x86 SFF PC, so it\\'s probably a net gain there, but that admin overhead thing isn\\'t necessarily one to ignore -- it\\'s not entirely set and forget.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                  \\n          \\n          kayge 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Man I loved my RPi remote SSH-tunnel for being able to access my home network from anywhere... until my kid needed a Pi for a robot he got for Christmas and I decided to donate mine to the cause :)\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          MezzoDelCammin 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  That\\'s exactly the right excuse to buy yourself a second hand mini PC and install proxmox / tailscale on it ; )\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                              \\n          \\n          elevation 3 months ago           \\n             | parent | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  If an idling raspberry pi is too power hungry, a microcontroller like an ESP32 could be made to respond to ARPs.  $8 for the MCU and a couple of afternoons of noodling.

The Raspi would wake it up 4 times a day, the server had a Task set up to run some Python scripts which invoked robocopy so that the server pulled the data off of another machine which was always on and required to be backed up.

Its a clearly useful thing for PCs all over the planet and it would be nice if they just went to sleep almost completely when idle and woke up on network or USB/PS2 input.

Its taking an awful long time for power saving features to mature.I would love to have this for my NAS/server, it has a lot of performance for when its needed but its also idle a lot.

Is that \"idle\"? There\\'s CPU and network activity. Suppose there is an open ssh connection to a server. It sends keepalives because the client is remote and behind a NAT, but there is no \"real\" activity. Should the server go to sleep?It\\'s entirely possible to be too aggressive. Samsung is proving this. They\\'ve disable \"unused\" apps by default. But \"unused\" just means you haven\\'t opened it in a while, not that you e.g. don\\'t have a reminder set in it to give you an alert for something which is happening in six months.Conversely, I wish web browsers were more aggressive about denying background tabs any use of the CPU whatsoever by default, and then allowing the user to make exceptions in the rare case where that\\'s needed.But in general the way to do this on the hardware side is per-component, and that\\'s largely already happening. Modern CPUs and other devices at idle shut down most of the silicon and use hardly any power. I\\'ve seen Core i7 desktops use 6 watts at idle. In that case you hardly even need suspend, what you really need is for the hardware makers to find what\\'s using the last 6 watts and get it down below 1.Conversely, I\\'ve seen server hardware that uses over 10 watts when it\\'s \"off\".\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          mardifoufs 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  I think Chrome added something like this recently.

And now iCloud has end to end encryption, there is little reason to bother doing it yourself.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          Aerbil313 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  > a solved problemThis is only because the vast majority of the population agrees that it’s a reasonable tradeoff to not bother with all the digital privacy and security stuff beyond what the defaults are and just go on with their lives. The reason behind this is that almost no one is significantly negatively affected by not being vigilant and self-hosting everything. The downside is that things like PRISM can exist and nation-states and any sufficiently powerful or skillful interested party can and do far more easily target, surveil and harm any individual they want. Again, those individuals are not your average Joe so the public doesn’t care. As long as you don’t leave the herd and stay in line, you’re safe. Personally, I didn’t give any f… about privacy until I felt there’s a good possibility US agencies can target me, due to things I would start to talk about online. Those things were not illegal neither in US nor in my country, just different ideologies from the status quo of modernity, but I knew for a fact people have been (illegally) arrested by US agencies before due to voicing similar things.[0][0]: https://web.archive.org/web/20221203231121/https://muslimske...\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                                    \\n          \\n          SoftTalker 3 months ago           \\n             | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  I just let my computer run all the time.

To build a low power system you need to find a good low power, high efficiency power supply.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          amiga386 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Does anyone know a good supplier for such supplies?For 10 years my home server used a Corsair VS350; it was fantastic, and very efficient at low power draw. Recently the fan failed. The PSU seems discontinued. The _fan_ seems discontinued. I\\'m going to try replacing the fan but I don\\'t know much about electronics. As a temporary measure, I got a regular \"gaming PC\" PSU and it has 10% more power draw, it\\'s not efficient at all.I\\'ve been looking for a replacement PSU, and I can only really find very high power ones - minimum about 550W - for reasonable prices. While you can run a low wattage PC on such PSUs, none of them make very much in the way of efficiency promises; only the highest certification, 80 Plus Titanium, makes efficiency promises for 10% load, e.g. it\\'ll be 90% efficient for a 55W load on a 550W supply. Lower certifications only promise to be e.g. 80% efficient for a 110W load on a 550W supply, and make no promises at all about a 55W or 30W load.So, how does one buy a good low power, high efficiency PSU, without it costing a fortune?\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          suyjuris 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  > I\\'m going to try replacing the fan but I don\\'t know much about electronics.Just in case: opening PSUs is dangerous without precautions. The capacitors may retain enough charge to kill.Besides the immediate risk to yourself, a PSU can also pose a fire hazard during operation, e.g. if improperly cooled.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                              \\n          \\n          heywire 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  This was measured with an old school Kill-a-Watt.

I tried suspending the server and power dropped to about 75W - not a huge saving.Another concern is drive longevity. Starting and stopping repeatedly during the day is a lot harder on them than running continuously and could lead to premature drive failure.

When I connect to the Pi to forward my PC\\'s RDP port to my laptop\\'s loopback interface, the Pi sends a normal magic packet to wake my PC. All that was needed was an entry like this in my laptop\\'s .ssh/config:  Host remote-desktop\\n          HostName raspberry-pi\\n          User pi\\n          Port 1234\\n          IdentityFile ~/.ssh/raspberry-pi-key\\n          LocalForward  3389 my-pc.local:3389\\n          SessionType default\\n          RemoteCommand wakeonlan -i 192.168.178.255 11:22:33:44:55:66; cat\\n\\nEach time the RDP port is forwarded, the wakeonlan command is run on the Raspberry Pi. The \\'cat\\' at the end keeps the command from exiting so that the RDP port keeps being forwarded. (I also configured the NOPASSWD option for wakeonlan in /etc/sudoers so that no root privileges are needed to run it.)\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          t0astbread 3 months ago           \\n             | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  There\\'s also the \"exec\" keyword that lets you run a command in a \"Match\" block like so:  Match host my-pc.local exec \"wakeonlan -i 192.168.178.255 11:22:33:44:55:66\"\\n\\nThis doesn\\'t cover the case when the connecting machine is in another network but it does avoid a hop. Perhaps you could also run another SSH command in the exec condition that connects to the Pi and has it send the WoL packet.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          LaputanMachine 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Thanks, this could be useful if I decide to set up a VPN in the future.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                              \\n          \\n          crizzlenizzle 3 months ago           \\n             | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  > Disable IPv6: this approach relies on ARP, which IPv6 doesn\\'t useI wish more people would care about IPv6.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          MrFoof 3 months ago           \\n             | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Especially when the reality is… you can almost go IPv6 only nowadays if you wanted to.I went down the rabbit hole recently, switching my network to IPv6 primary with IPv4 as the fallback.  The ultimate test was disabling IPv4 for a weekend to see what, if anything, broke.I had set up DNS64, NAT64 and 464XLAT.  The only weirdness is how Windows clients handle IPv6 literals in UNC paths, which is super ugly, and how some applications (like Discord calls) will actually embed IPv4 literals.  Discord apparently does that for the relay servers for calls.Those things — and the rare website not supporting it - aside, I could actually be IPv6 only.  I have IPv4 enabled as a fallback now, but it’s no longer primary on my network.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          ninkendo 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  464XLAT should work fine with ipv4 literals, no? At least on macOS, this will get routed to a local 192.0.0.2 interface, which does the CLAT, translates it to an ipv6 64:ff9b::<ipv4> address, and relays it to your nat64 server. The ipv4-only software doesn\\'t know any different, and the only traffic going on your LAN is ipv6.I\\'m not sure if windows works the same way though...(Edit: Looks like windows can do this, but it only configures it for WWAN interfaces, go figure: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-os-platform/c...)\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          MrFoof 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Discord calls on Windows was the only exception I ran into, because as you found yourself, it functionally had to fallback on DNS64.  In general, some peer-to-peer situations are the likely one of the few cases where it will end up falling back onto DNS64 for resolution.  This isn’t something I entirely realized myself — I’m apparently far from the only person to discover this behavior (Discord embedding IPv4 literals for its relay servers).  Discord has had tickets open about it for years so far.I appreciate my son being patient on that one, but he appreciated how seriously I dug into everything.  Again, we have IPv4 enabled again as fallback, but the family agreed for an IPv6-only weekend as a test, and that was the only thing (outside of one website) that failed.Everything else worked perfectly, including tons of legacy devices and software, some of which had no concept of IPv6.For 464XLAT on clients, phones are actually the leaders here.  It’s worked perfectly on at least iOS (and I assume Android) for a LONG time because of its built-in automatic tunneling.  Mac OS had some recent improvements in Ventura to make things easier.  Windows absolutely has some quirks, the biggest being IPv6 literals in UNC paths ending up using a domain Microsoft doesn’t actually own - a potential huge future attack vector.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                        \\n          \\n          kube-system 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  > you can almost go IPv6 only nowadays if you wanted to.I think that is the reason why many aren\\'t enthusiastic about it.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          MrFoof 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Again, I disabled IPv4 purely for testing reasons, to guarantee nothing was using IPv4 without me knowing it.  There’s no reason to actually disable IPv4 as a fallback.Over 99.999% of traffic through my home network is IPv6 now.  The tiny remainder that has to use IPv4 does, without issue.  5 months on, and nary a complaint.  Just works.The world is ready for IPv6 as your primary, with IPv4 as the fallback.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          0x457 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Not really.

With keepalive disabled, proper Wi-Fi adapter sleep behavior and long enough DHCP leases, I was able to put my PC to sleep and come back the next day and still have my sessions active on resume. Unfortunately it wasn\\'t too practical to disable keepalive as sessions that really do crash never get cleaned up.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                                          \\n          \\n          xyst 3 months ago           \\n             | parent | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Especially when NDP covers all of the features of ARP\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          j16sdiz 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  > Especially when NDP covers all of the features of ARP... and more.and lots of options with varies level of support. \\nToo many switch and flags to fiddle with.Someone in IEEE need to publish a Current Best Pratice list and deprecate all other options.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                        \\n          \\n          jonathantf2 3 months ago           \\n             | parent | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  I wish I could care about IPv6 but I\\'ve never used it, my ISP doesn\\'t provide it and I\\'ve never once seen it deployed in a business environment\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                  \\n          \\n          zbrozek 3 months ago           \\n             | parent | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Seems unlikely.

Granted, same with IPv4 and DHCP.If you don\\'t have a router, most things should work thanks to link-local+mDNS.You can easily pop a second router on the network to bridge two LANs, no need to reconfigure the DHCP. Gateways self-advertise, etc.The point I\\'m trying to make is that most people trying toconfigure their IPv4 network have a functional IPv6 network the moment they put the cables in (on Linuxes es at least, not sure about other platforms).\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                                    \\n          \\n          NoGravitas 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Is that mostly mobile phones while on cellular data, perhaps?\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          soupbowl 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  I am sure a large percent of it is.

But I\\'m pessimistic on that front. cgNAT is too easy and works just well enough to make adopting something better too low a priority to ever happen.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                        \\n          \\n          samdcbu 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  The increasing prices of IPv4 address blocks will probably drive adoption of IPv6. The increased complexity will be outweighed by the elimination of scarcity that IPv6 brings. If we are still using IPv4 in 2100 that would be tragic.\\nIPv4 block pricing:  https://ipv4marketgroup.com/ipv4-pricing/\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                        \\n          \\n          slashdev 3 months ago           \\n             | parent | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Who cares about IPv6 on a home server that you might not even want to expose to the public internet anyway?\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          miyuru 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  I care.

My anecdata: I have had four Seagate HDDs in my desktop PC since 2007 and despite a couple of remapped sectors, they\\'re still working fine.I often power it on and off 1-2 times a day, and the drives are set to spin down when not in use. The SMART data for these drives shows approximately 37,000 power on hours and 17,000 start/stop cycles. That\\'s about 4 years 3 months of actual power on time, and about 3 power cycles per year over the past 16 years.The spec sheet says these drives use 8W idle. So:192 months - 51 months = 141 months of non-use141 months * 0.730 kilohours / month = 102.93 kilohours102.93 kilohours * 32 watts = 3293.76 kwhAssuming 15 cents per kwh, that comes to $494 saved by shutting the drives down over the past 16 years. And I paid $232 total for the drives back in 2007.Obviously YMMV, just thought it would be fun to calculate :)\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          usr1106 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  That might possibly be close where you live, but not where I live. I need to heat my home at least 8 months a year and I heat using electricity (which isn\\'t the smartest thing to do, but that\\'s the way the house was built 30 years ago). It is too hot inside less than 4 weeks a year. So saving energy is done by trying to live in cooler rooms, but not by searching for small consumers.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          tfvlrue 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  I\\'m curious if you mean the 15 cents per kwh estimate is too high or too low? It\\'s a conservative average for me in upstate NY over the past ~15 years.If you\\'re using electric resistance heat, then I suppose a running computer is kind of like processing power plus \"free\" heat :)\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          usr1106 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Prices obviosly differ a whole lot depending on the country. My point was not absolute monetary savings, but energy saving.My school physics tells me that nearly everything you do with electricity at home will heat your home. Doesn\\'t matter whether it\\'s the baking oven, the computer or the fridge. So if you heat using electricity and live in cold climate saving energy for computers or household appliances just moves the same consumption to heating.The big exception is heating water. That energy is typically lost to the sewer.As long as you pay the same electricity price for your computer as for your heating, it does not make a differencd whether that\\'s 7 or 50 cent or the 15 you estimated.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                              \\n          \\n          MayeulC 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  You probably meant 3 power cycles a day.What is your spin-down time?\\nI use the following on my server\\'s fstab:     UUID=\"abcd\" /data btrfs defaults,noauto,compress=zstd,x-systemd.automount,x-systemd.mount-timeout=1min,x-systemd.idle-timeout=30min\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          tfvlrue 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Oops.

Suspend and resume is still buggy as hell.  Power management in general in Linux is still awful after all these years.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          1970-01-01 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Low-level power savings (s3 sleep) and magic packet (Wake-on-LAN) have been a standard since the late 90s. Getting a Linux OS that actually delivers these standardized power features is now a 20+ year old bug. I can only imagine the amount of energy that would have been saved if this bug was properly fixed 25 years ago. With solid-state tech becoming cheaper every day, I now expect nobody will make an \"it just works\" OS that has both sleep and wake working on-demand. Globally, the HDDs will simply continue to spin until there are none.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          usr1106 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Who pays for Linux development?

Not a single one was able to survive this:- Do some work on it\\n - Close the lid\\n - Drive somewhere else\\n - Resume workAt best, the laptop would freeze and require a hard reset (extra annoying on Dell XPS for some reason). At worst, it will be completely draining of power. All of my linux-loving colleges had the same issues.

I used to keep the PC up most of the day, and get it to sleep on schedule during night with `rtcwake`, and it was pretty reliable.I\\'ve removed the scheduled sleep from the PC, as I prefer backups to be done at night, and my \"minilab\" of USFF PC with SSD & 2 external HDDs, rpi 4 with SSD and a 1Gb switch uses 18W idle, according to cheap power mater.USFF PC is ThinkCentre tiny m93p with 2-core 4th-gen i5, and I guess newer models should fare better with idle power use.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          fy20 3 months ago           \\n             | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  How reliable is the external drive route?

The desktop runs a small Go program that I\\'ve written that shuts it down after ten minutes of inactivity. Wake-on-unicast for some reason always caused the desktop to start up after just a few seconds of being shut down, so I\\'m using magic packets. (I\\'m not sure what\\'s causing this. I suspect Tailscale but I haven\\'t really investigated it.) Hydra connects via SSH so I\\'ve added a Match block to the potato\\'s SSH config that sends the WoL packet first:  Match host desktop.local exec /bla/bla/send-wol\\n\\nI\\'m also doing full shutdowns instead of sleeping. The difference is only about ten seconds for a CI job. If the power draw during sleep turns out to be negligible, I might switch to that at some point but first, there are bigger bottlenecks to kill (like Hydra still running expensive evaluations on the potato).\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                  \\n          \\n          saltcured 3 months ago           \\n             | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Tangentially, I remember MythTV had support for the self-scheduled variant of this. I used to have a PC with multiple HDDs hooked to the TV and antenna which would look at its own TV recording schedule and power off when it was idle and wouldn\\'t be recording in the next hour or less. Before powering off, it would set an RTC alarm to wake 10 minutes before the next scheduled recording. Meanwhile, if I walked into the room and wanted to watch recordings while it was off, I would just press the power button let it boot up to use the onscreen UI with IR remote control. I never bothered to figure out if I could make the IR receiver behave in some standby mode to wake the PC.The next time we moved, I couldn\\'t be bothered to set all this up again. Now we just use an old laptop and browser for streaming and a bluetooth keyboard with pointing device for \"remote\" control. It idles at low enough power to run 24/7 and not care, but we can also just open/close the lid as if it is a sleep switch for the media function.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                  \\n          \\n          tzs 3 months ago           \\n             | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  > To prevent unwanted wake-ups, you\\'ll need to ensure no device on the network is sending extraneous packets to the serverAssume the home network is using 10.0.x addresses.I wonder if it would be useful to put the server on 10.1.x, add a virtual ethernet interface to the RPi that is also on 10.1.x, and configure the RPi to route between 10.0.x and 10.1.x.

I believe with runtime (opportunistic) S0ix on x86 we\\'d be able to get similarly low power consumption at idle, but that would require cooperation from all devices and system firmware. It\\'s already a thing on laptops, where if certain conditions are met, the laptop can technically be \"sleeping\" when the screen is displaying static content, like a document.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                  \\n          \\n          otterpro 3 months ago           \\n             | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  I have servers that I don\\'t want to run 24/7 but I still need to access them from time to time.  My current solution was to schedule shutdown of all the servers between 12am - 6am (usingcron) and start them up at 6am (using BIOS scheduled power-on), to save on electricity cost since no one uses them during those hours.  However, this is much elegant solution.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                  \\n          \\n          unnouinceput 3 months ago           \\n             | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  If you\\'re involving an RPi in this, in order to save power, might as well just have the RPi be the main driving force behind everything. Flip a switch to power on the server, command the backup once a custom app on server informs the RPi that server is ready, shutdown the server again by setting the above switch to OFF. This way your server will not even consume those idle watts when waiting for wake packets.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                  \\n          \\n          jasoneckert 3 months ago           \\n             | prev | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  While it is easy to criticize the approach the author took to solve this particular problem (as others have done here), I must say that I appreciate well organized posts that detail a technology problem and solution.

Basically the network interface accepts any old packet, and then maybe wakes up depending on the content of the packet.You can configure it to wake up if it sees any packet (what he did). The problem is networks are rarely completely silent and your machine will just wake up randomly.Which is why they invented \"MagicPacket(tm)\" which is just any old packet that happens to contain a specific repeated byte pattern. The network card will wake up on any packet that happens to contain that pattern (which shouldn\\'t happen randomly).I don\\'t know why he didn\\'t use MagicPacket, even though he mentioned the problem it solves.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          0x457 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  He explained why: he wanted the server to wake just when someone is tried to SSH to it.\\n                      \\n                  \\n      \\n        \\n                      \\n          \\n          IshKebab 3 months ago           \\n             | root | parent | next [–]          \\n                  \\n                  Ah yes you are right.

This is a collection of PowerShell utilities I put together either for fun or because I had a narrow application in mind.\\n\\nAs such the mileage you get out of them may vary but feel free to post issues or fork & adapt!\\n\\nWindows API\\n\\nSome resources to consult on Windows API access from PowerShell:\\n\\nFuzzySecurity: Low-Level Windows API Access From PowerShell\\n\\nMicrosoft TechNet: Use PowerShell to Interact with the Windows API\\n\\nExploit Monday: Accessing the Windows API in PowerShell via internal .NET methods and reflection\\n\\nExploit Monday: Deep Reflection - Defining Structs and Enums in PowerShell\\n\\nInvoke-Runas\\n\\nFunctionally equivalent to Windows \"runas.exe\", using Advapi32::CreateProcessWithLogonW.\\n\\nInvoke-NetSessionEnum\\n\\nUse Netapi32::NetSessionEnum to enumerate active sessions on domain joined machines.\\n\\nInvoke-CreateProcess\\n\\nUse Kernel32::CreateProcess to achieve fine-grained control over process creation from PowerShell.\\n\\nDetect-Debug\\n\\nShowcase a number of techniques to detect the presence of Kernel/User-Mode debuggers from PowerShell.\\n\\nGet-Handles\\n\\nUse NtQuerySystemInformation::SystemHandleInformation to get a list of open handles in the specified process, works on x32/x64.\\n\\nGet-TokenPrivs\\n\\nOpen a handle to a process and use Advapi32::GetTokenInformation to list the privileges associated with the process token.\\n\\nGet-Exports\\n\\nGet-Exports, fetches DLL exports and optionally provides C++ wrapper output (idential to ExportsToC++ but without needing VS and a compiled binary). To do this it reads DLL bytes into memory and then parses them (no LoadLibraryEx). Because of this you can parse x32/x64 DLL\\'s regardless of the bitness of PowerShell.\\n\\nGet-SystemModuleInformation\\n\\nUse NtQuerySystemInformation::SystemModuleInformation to get a list of loaded modules, their base address and size (x32/x64).\\n\\nExpose-NetAPI\\n\\nA crude tool to expose .NET API classes to PowerShell through reflection. This includes internal private classes, such as Microsoft.Win32.UnsafeNativeMethods.\\n\\nGet-ProcessMiniDump\\n\\nCreate process dump using Dbghelp::MiniDumpWriteDump.\\n\\nGet-SystemProcessInformation\\n\\nUse NtQuerySystemInformation::SystemProcessInformation to get a detailed list of processes and process properties. On close inspection you will find that many process monitors such as Sysinternals Process Explorer or Process Hacker use this information class (in addition to SystemPerformanceInformation, SystemProcessorPerformanceInformation and SystemProcessorCycleTimeInformation).\\n\\nGet-OSTokenInformation\\n\\nGet-OSTokenInformation uses a variety of API\\'s to pull in all (accessible) user tokens and queries them for details.\\n\\nNative-HardLink\\n\\nThis is a proof-of-concept for NT hard links. There are some advantages, from an offensive perspective, to using NtSetInformationFile to create hard links (as opposed to mklink/CreateHardLink). NtSetInformationFile allows us link to files we don’t have write access to.\\n\\npwnd\\n\\nStart-Hollow\\n\\nThis is a proof-of-concept for process hollowing. There is nothing new here except maybe the use of NtCreateProcessEx which has some advantages in that it offers a convenient way to set a parent process and avoids the bothersome Get/SetThreadContext. On the flipside CreateRemoteThreadEx/NtCreateThreadEx are pretty suspicious API\\'s.\\n\\nStart-Eidolon\\n\\nThis is a proof-of-concept for doppelgänging, which was recently presented by enSilo at BlackHat EU. In simple terms this process involves creating an NTFS transaction from a file on disk (any file will do). Next we overwrite the file in memory, create a section from the modified file and launch a process based on that section. Afterwards we roll back the transaction, leaving the original file unchanged but we end up with a process that appears to be backed by the original file. For a more complete description please review the reference in the script.\\n\\nStage-RemoteDll\\n\\nStage-RemoteDll is a small function to demonstrate various Dll injection techniques (NtCreateThreadEx / QueueUserAPC / SetThreadContext / SetWindowsHookEx) on 32 and 64 bit architectures. While I have done some input validation & cleanup, this is mostly POC code. Note also that these techniques can easily be repurposed to directly execute shellcode in the remote process.\\n\\nExport-LNKPwn\\n\\nCreate LNK files to exploit CVE-2017-8464 aka LNK round 3 ;))!\\n\\nCurrently, it is recommended that you create the lnk locally and then move it to the target system because of .Net and PowerShell dependencies. Please refer to the function synopsis for further details.\\n\\nUAC-TokenMagic\\n\\nBased on James Forshaw\\'s three part post on UAC, linked below, and possibly a technique used by the CIA!\\n\\nEssentially we duplicate the token of an elevated process, lower it\\'s mandatory integrity level, use it to create a new restricted token, impersonate it and use the Secondary Logon service to spawn a new process with High IL. Like playing hide-and-go-seek with tokens! ;))\\n\\nThis technique even bypasses the AlwaysNotify setting provided you supply it with a PID for an elevated process.\\n\\nTargets:\\n7,8,8.1,10,10RS1,10RS2\\n\\nBypass-UAC\\n\\nBypass-UAC provides a framework to perform UAC bypasses based on auto elevating IFileOperation COM object method calls. This is not a new technique, traditionally, this is accomplished by injecting a DLL into “explorer.exe”. This is not desirable because injecting into explorer may trigger security alerts and working with unmanaged DLL’s makes for an inflexible work-flow.\\n\\nTo get around this, Bypass-UAC implements a function which rewrites PowerShell’s PEB to give it the appearance of “explorer.exe”. This provides the same effect because COM objects exclusively rely on Windows’s Process Status API (PSAPI) which reads the process PEB.\\n\\nMasquerade-PEB\\n\\nMasquerade-PEB uses NtQueryInformationProcess to get a handle to powershell\\'s PEB. From there it replaces a number of UNICODE_STRING structs in memory to give powershell the appearance of a different process. Specifically, the function will overwrite powershell\\'s \"ImagePathName\" & \"CommandLine\" in _RTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS and the \"FullDllName\" & \"BaseDllName\" in the _LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY linked list.\\n\\nThis can be useful as it would fool any Windows work-flows which rely solely on the Process Status API to check process identity.\\n\\nInvoke-SMBShell\\n\\nPOC shell using named pipes (System.IO.Pipes) as a C2 channel. The SMB traffic is encrypted using AES CBC (code from Empire), the key/pipe are generated randomly by the server on start-up.\\n\\nServer:\\n\\nClient:\\n\\nConjure-LSASS\\n\\nUse the SeDebugPrivilege to duplicate the LSASS access token and impersonate it in the calling thread. If SeDebugPrivilege is disabled the function will re-enable it.\\n\\nInvoke-MS16-032\\n\\nPowerShell implementation of MS16-032. The exploit targets all vulnerable operating systems that support PowerShell v2+. Credit for the discovery of the bug and the logic to exploit it go to James Forshaw (@tiraniddo).\\n\\nTargets:\\n\\nWin7-Win10 & 2k8-2k12 <== 32/64 bit!\\n\\nTested on x32 Win7, x64 Win8, x64 2k12R2\\n\\n==> Not tested on Vista with PowerShell v1, let me know what happens if you are able to check this!\\n\\nSubvert-PE\\n\\nInject shellcode into a PE image while retaining the PE functionality.\\n\\nFor additional information, please refer to:\\n\\nFuzzySecurity: Powershell PE Injection, this is not the Calc you are looking for!\\n\\nUtility\\n\\nGet-LimitChildItem\\n\\nDepth limited wrapper for Get-ChildItem with basic filter functionality.\\n\\nGet-CRC32\\n\\nA simple wrapper for the undocumented RtlComputeCrc32 function.\\n\\nTrace-Execution\\n\\nUses the Capstone engine to recursively disassemble a PE (x32/x64) from it\\'s entry point, effectively \"following\" execution flow. The following rules are observed:\\n\\njmp\\'s are taken if they fall in the PE address space\\n\\ncall\\'s are taken if they fall in the PE address space\\n\\nret\\'s are taken and use the return address stored by call instructions\\n\\nindirect call/jmp\\'s are not taken\\n\\nconditional jmp\\'s are not taken\\n\\ncall/jmp\\'s which reference a register are not taken\\n\\nThere are many many edge cases here which can make disassembly unreliable. As a general rule, the more addresses you disassemble, the less trustworthy the output is. The call table can be used as a reference to gauge the veracity of the output.\\n\\nSince disassembly is static, working of a byte array, x32/x64 PE\\'s can be disassembled regardless of the bitness of PowerShell.\\n\\nCalculate-Hash\\n\\nPowerShell v2 compatible script to calculate file hashes. I quickly scripted this together because Get-FileHash is only available in v4+.\\n\\nCheck-VTFile\\n\\nSubmit SHA256 hash of a file to Virus Total and retrieve the scan report if the hash is known. This requires you to get a, free, VirusTotal API key. Again, lot\\'s of better projects out there for this but not PowerShell v2 compatible.\\n\\nAbout\\n\\nMy musings with PowerShell\\n\\nResources\\n\\nReadme\\n\\nLicense\\n\\nBSD-3-Clause license\\n\\nActivity\\n\\nStars\\n\\n2.5k\\n    stars\\n\\nWatchers\\n\\n176\\n    watching\\n\\nForks\\n\\n788\\n    forks\\n\\nReport repository\\n\\nReleases\\n\\nNo releases published\\n\\nSponsor this project\\n\\nFuzzySecurity\\n          b33f\\n\\nSponsor\\n\\nLearn more about GitHub Sponsors\\n\\nPackages\\n      0\\n\\n\\n        No packages published \\n\\nLanguages\\n\\nPowerShell\\n          95.3%\\n\\nC\\n          3.9%\\n\\nC#\\n          0.8%', metadata={'source': 'https://github.com/FuzzySecurity/PowerShell-Suite'}),\n Document(page_content='Documentation\\n\\nThe Java™ Tutorials\\n\\nHide TOC\\n\\nWorking with URLs\\n\\nWhat Is a URL?\\n\\nCreating a URL\\n\\nParsing a URL\\n\\nReading Directly from a URL\\n\\nConnecting to a URL\\n\\nReading from and Writing to a URLConnection\\n\\nHome Page\\n                >\\n\\nCustom Networking\\n                >\\n\\nWorking with URLs\\n\\n«\\xa0Previous\\xa0•\\n\\nTrail\\xa0•\\n\\nNext\\xa0»\\n\\nThe Java Tutorials have been written for JDK 8.

The openStream() method returns a \\njava.io.InputStream object, so reading from a URL is as easy as reading from an input stream.\\n\\nThe following small Java program uses openStream() to get an input stream on the URL http://www.oracle.com/. It then opens a BufferedReader on the input stream and reads from the BufferedReader thereby reading from the URL. Everything read is copied to the standard output stream:\\n\\nWhen you run the program, you should see, scrolling by in your command window, the HTML commands and textual content from the HTML file located at http://www.oracle.com/. Alternatively, the program might hang or you might see an exception stack trace.

The methods that add, subtract, or\\nrearrange their members in place, and don’t return a specific item, never return\\nthe collection instance itself but None.\\n\\nSome operations are supported by several object types; in particular,\\npractically all objects can be compared for equality, tested for truth\\nvalue, and converted to a string (with the repr() function or the\\nslightly different str() function).  The latter function is implicitly\\nused when an object is written by the print() function.\\n\\nTruth Value Testing¶\\n\\nAny object can be tested for truth value, for use in an if or\\nwhile condition or as operand of the Boolean operations below.\\n\\nBy default, an object is considered true unless its class defines either a\\n__bool__() method that returns False or a __len__() method that\\nreturns zero, when called with the object. 1  Here are most of the built-in\\nobjects considered false:\\n\\nconstants defined to be false: None and False\\n\\nzero of any numeric type: 0, 0.0, 0j, Decimal(0),\\nFraction(0, 1)\\n\\nempty sequences and collections: \\'\\', (), [], {}, set(),\\nrange(0)\\n\\nFalse\\n\\nTrue\\n\\nor\\n\\nand\\n\\nBoolean Operations — and, or, not¶\\n\\nThese are the Boolean operations, ordered by ascending priority:\\n\\nOperation\\n\\nResult\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nx or y\\n\\nif x is true, then x, else\\ny\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nx and y\\n\\nif x is false, then x, else\\ny\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nnot x\\n\\nif x is false, then True,\\nelse False\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\nThis is a short-circuit operator, so it only evaluates the second\\nargument if the first one is false.\\n\\nThis is a short-circuit operator, so it only evaluates the second\\nargument if the first one is true.\\n\\nnot has a lower priority than non-Boolean operators, so not a == b is\\ninterpreted as not (a == b), and a == not b is a syntax error.\\n\\nComparisons¶\\n\\nThere are eight comparison operations in Python.  They all have the same\\npriority (which is higher than that of the Boolean operations).  Comparisons can\\nbe chained arbitrarily; for example, x < y <= z is equivalent to x < y and\\ny <= z, except that y is evaluated only once (but in both cases z is not\\nevaluated at all when x < y is found to be false).\\n\\nThis table summarizes the comparison operations:\\n\\nOperation\\n\\nMeaning\\n\\nstrictly less than\\n\\n<=\\n\\nless than or equal\\n\\nstrictly greater than\\n\\n>=\\n\\ngreater than or equal\\n\\n==\\n\\nequal\\n\\n!=\\n\\nnot equal\\n\\nis\\n\\nobject identity\\n\\nis not\\n\\nnegated object identity\\n\\n==\\n\\nis. The\\n\\n<=\\n\\n>=\\n\\nTypeError exception when one of the arguments is a complex number.\\n\\nNon-identical instances of a class normally compare as non-equal unless the\\nclass defines the __eq__() method.\\n\\n__lt__(),\\n\\n__le__(),\\n\\n__gt__(), and\\n\\n__ge__() (in general,\\n\\n__lt__() and\\n\\n__eq__() are sufficient, if you want the conventional meanings of the\\ncomparison operators).\\n\\nThe behavior of the is and is not operators cannot be\\ncustomized; also they can be applied to any two objects and never raise an\\nexception.\\n\\nTwo more operations with the same syntactic priority, in and\\nnot in, are supported by types that are iterable or\\nimplement the __contains__() method.\\n\\nNumeric Types — int, float, complex¶\\n\\ndouble in C; information\\nabout the precision and internal representation of floating point\\nnumbers for the machine on which your program is running is available\\nin\\n\\nsys.float_info.  Complex numbers have a real and imaginary\\npart, which are each a floating point number.  To extract these parts\\nfrom a complex number\\n\\nz.real\\n\\nz.imag\\n\\nfractions.Fraction, for\\nrationals, and\\n\\ndecimal.Decimal, for floating-point numbers with\\nuser-definable precision.)\\n\\nNumbers are created by numeric literals or as the result of built-in functions\\nand operators.  Unadorned integer literals (including hex, octal and binary\\nnumbers) yield integers.  Numeric literals containing a decimal point or an\\nexponent sign yield floating point numbers.  Appending \\'j\\' or \\'J\\' to a\\nnumeric literal yields an imaginary number (a complex number with a zero real\\npart) which you can add to an integer or float to get a complex number with real\\nand imaginary parts.\\n\\nPython fully supports mixed arithmetic: when a binary arithmetic operator has\\noperands of different numeric types, the operand with the “narrower” type is\\nwidened to that of the other, where integer is narrower than floating point,\\nwhich is narrower than complex. A comparison between numbers of different types\\nbehaves as though the exact values of those numbers were being compared. 2\\n\\nThe constructors int(), float(), and\\ncomplex() can be used to produce numbers of a specific type.\\n\\nAll numeric types (except complex) support the following operations (for priorities of\\nthe operations, see Operator precedence):\\n\\nOperation\\n\\nResult\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nFull documentation\\n\\nx + y\\n\\nsum of x and y\\n\\nx - y\\n\\ndifference of x and y\\n\\nx * y\\n\\nproduct of x and y\\n\\nx / y\\n\\nquotient of x and y\\n\\nx // y\\n\\nfloored quotient of x and\\ny\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nx % y\\n\\nremainder of x / y\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nx\\n\\nx negated\\n\\n+x\\n\\nx unchanged\\n\\nabs(x)\\n\\nabsolute value or magnitude of\\nx\\n\\nabs()\\n\\nint(x)\\n\\nx converted to integer\\n\\n(3)(6)\\n\\nint()\\n\\nfloat(x)\\n\\nx converted to floating point\\n\\n(4)(6)\\n\\nfloat()\\n\\ncomplex(re, im)\\n\\na complex number with real part\\nre, imaginary part im.\\nim defaults to zero.\\n\\n(6)\\n\\ncomplex()\\n\\nc.conjugate()\\n\\nconjugate of the complex number\\nc\\n\\ndivmod(x, y)\\n\\nthe pair (x // y, x % y)\\n\\n(2)\\n\\ndivmod()\\n\\npow(x, y)\\n\\nx to the power y\\n\\n(5)\\n\\npow()\\n\\nx ** y\\n\\nx to the power y\\n\\n(5)\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\nAlso referred to as integer division.  The resultant value is a whole\\ninteger, though the result’s type is not necessarily int.  The result is\\nalways rounded towards minus infinity: 1//2 is 0, (-1)//2 is\\n-1, 1//(-2) is -1, and (-1)//(-2) is 0.\\n\\nNot for complex numbers.  Instead convert to floats using abs() if\\nappropriate.\\n\\nConversion from float to int truncates, discarding the\\nfractional part. See functions math.floor() and math.ceil() for\\nalternative conversions.\\n\\nfloat also accepts the strings “nan” and “inf” with an optional prefix “+”\\nor “-” for Not a Number (NaN) and positive or negative infinity.\\n\\nPython defines pow(0, 0) and 0 ** 0 to be 1, as is common for\\nprogramming languages.\\n\\nThe numeric literals accepted include the digits 0 to 9 or any\\nUnicode equivalent (code points with the Nd property).\\nSee https://www.unicode.org/Public/14.0.0/ucd/extracted/DerivedNumericType.txt\\nfor a complete list of code points with the Nd property.\\n\\nAll numbers.Real types (int and float) also include\\nthe following operations:\\n\\nOperation\\n\\nResult\\n\\nmath.trunc(x)\\n\\nx truncated to Integral\\n\\nround(x[,\\nn])\\n\\nx rounded to n digits,\\nrounding half to even. If n is\\nomitted, it defaults to 0.\\n\\nmath.floor(x)\\n\\nthe greatest Integral\\n<= x\\n\\nmath.ceil(x)\\n\\nthe least Integral >= x\\n\\nFor additional numeric operations see the math and cmath\\nmodules.\\n\\nBitwise Operations on Integer Types¶\\n\\nBitwise operations only make sense for integers. The result of bitwise\\noperations is calculated as though carried out in two’s complement with an\\ninfinite number of sign bits.\\n\\nThe priorities of the binary bitwise operations are all lower than the numeric\\noperations and higher than the comparisons; the unary operation ~ has the\\nsame priority as the other unary numeric operations (+ and -).\\n\\nThis table lists the bitwise operations sorted in ascending priority:\\n\\nOperation\\n\\nResult\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nx | y\\n\\nbitwise or of x and\\ny\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nx ^ y\\n\\nbitwise exclusive or of\\nx and y\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nx & y\\n\\nbitwise and of x and\\ny\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nx << n\\n\\nx shifted left by n bits\\n\\n(1)(2)\\n\\nx >> n\\n\\nx shifted right by n bits\\n\\n(1)(3)\\n\\n~x\\n\\nthe bits of x inverted\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\nNegative shift counts are illegal and cause a ValueError to be raised.\\n\\nA left shift by n bits is equivalent to multiplication by pow(2, n).\\n\\nA right shift by n bits is equivalent to floor division by pow(2, n).\\n\\nPerforming these calculations with at least one extra sign extension bit in\\na finite two’s complement representation (a working bit-width of\\n1 + max(x.bit_length(), y.bit_length()) or more) is sufficient to get the\\nsame result as if there were an infinite number of sign bits.\\n\\nAdditional Methods on Integer Types¶\\n\\nThe int type implements the numbers.Integral abstract base\\nclass. In addition, it provides a few more methods:\\n\\nint.\\n\\nbit_length\\n\\nReturn the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary,\\nexcluding the sign and leading zeros:\\n>>>>>> n = -37\\n>>> bin(n)\\n\\'-0b100101\\'\\n>>> n.bit_length()\\n6\\n\\n\\nMore precisely, if x is nonzero, then x.bit_length() is the\\nunique positive integer k such that 2**(k-1) <= abs(x) < 2**k.\\nEquivalently, when abs(x) is small enough to have a correctly\\nrounded logarithm, then k = 1 + int(log(abs(x), 2)).\\nIf x is zero, then x.bit_length() returns 0.\\nEquivalent to:\\ndef bit_length(self):\\n    s = bin(self)       # binary representation:  bin(-37) --> \\'-0b100101\\'\\n    s = s.lstrip(\\'-0b\\') # remove leading zeros and minus sign\\n    return len(s)       # len(\\'100101\\') --> 6\\n\\n\\n\\nNew in version 3.1.\\n\\nint.\\n\\nbit_count\\n\\nReturn the number of ones in the binary representation of the absolute\\nvalue of the integer. This is also known as the population count.\\nExample:\\n>>>>>> n = 19\\n>>> bin(n)\\n\\'0b10011\\'\\n>>> n.bit_count()\\n3\\n>>> (-n).bit_count()\\n3\\n\\n\\nEquivalent to:\\ndef bit_count(self):\\n    return bin(self).count(\"1\")\\n\\n\\n\\nNew in version 3.10.\\n\\nint.\\n\\nto_bytes\\n\\nlength\\n\\nbyteorder\\n\\n\\'big\\'\\n\\nsigned\\n\\nFalse\\n\\nReturn an array of bytes representing an integer.\\n>>>>>> (1024).to_bytes(2, byteorder=\\'big\\')\\nb\\'\\\\x04\\\\x00\\'\\n>>> (1024).to_bytes(10, byteorder=\\'big\\')\\nb\\'\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x04\\\\x00\\'\\n>>> (-1024).to_bytes(10, byteorder=\\'big\\', signed=True)\\nb\\'\\\\xff\\\\xff\\\\xff\\\\xff\\\\xff\\\\xff\\\\xff\\\\xff\\\\xfc\\\\x00\\'\\n>>> x = 1000\\n>>> x.to_bytes((x.bit_length() + 7) // 8, byteorder=\\'little\\')\\nb\\'\\\\xe8\\\\x03\\'\\n\\n\\nThe integer is represented using length bytes, and defaults to 1.  An\\nOverflowError is raised if the integer is not representable with\\nthe given number of bytes.\\nThe byteorder argument determines the byte order used to represent the\\ninteger, and defaults to \"big\".  If byteorder is\\n\"big\", the most significant byte is at the beginning of the byte\\narray.

For ease of implementation and\\nefficiency across a variety of numeric types (including\\n\\nint,\\n\\nfloat,\\n\\ndecimal.Decimal and\\n\\nfractions.Fraction)\\nPython’s hash for numeric types is based on a single mathematical function\\nthat’s defined for any rational number, and hence applies to all instances of\\n\\nint and\\n\\nfractions.Fraction, and all finite instances of\\n\\nfloat and\\n\\ndecimal.Decimal.

This is implemented\\nusing two distinct methods; these are used to allow user-defined classes to\\nsupport iteration.  Sequences, described below in more detail, always support\\nthe iteration methods.\\n\\nOne method needs to be defined for container objects to provide iterable\\nsupport:\\n\\ncontainer.\\n\\n__iter__\\n\\nReturn an iterator object.  The object is required to support the\\niterator protocol described below.  If a container supports different types\\nof iteration, additional methods can be provided to specifically request\\niterators for those iteration types.  (An example of an object supporting\\nmultiple forms of iteration would be a tree structure which supports both\\nbreadth-first and depth-first traversal.)  This method corresponds to the\\ntp_iter slot of the type structure for Python\\nobjects in the Python/C API.\\n\\nThe iterator objects themselves are required to support the following two\\nmethods, which together form the iterator protocol:\\n\\niterator.\\n\\n__iter__\\n\\nReturn the iterator object itself.  This is required to allow both\\ncontainers and iterators to be used with the for and\\nin statements.  This method corresponds to the\\ntp_iter slot of the type structure for Python\\nobjects in the Python/C API.\\n\\niterator.\\n\\n__next__\\n\\nReturn the next item from the iterator.  If there are no further\\nitems, raise the StopIteration exception.  This method corresponds to\\nthe tp_iternext slot of the type structure for\\nPython objects in the Python/C API.\\n\\nPython defines several iterator objects to support iteration over general and\\nspecific sequence types, dictionaries, and other more specialized forms.  The\\nspecific types are not important beyond their implementation of the iterator\\nprotocol.\\n\\nOnce an iterator’s __next__() method raises\\nStopIteration, it must continue to do so on subsequent calls.\\nImplementations that do not obey this property are deemed broken.\\n\\nGenerator Types¶\\n\\nPython’s generators provide a convenient way to implement the iterator\\nprotocol.  If a container object’s __iter__() method is implemented as a\\ngenerator, it will automatically return an iterator object (technically, a\\ngenerator object) supplying the __iter__() and __next__()\\nmethods.\\nMore information about generators can be found in the documentation for\\nthe yield expression.\\n\\nSequence Types — list, tuple, range¶\\n\\nThere are three basic sequence types: lists, tuples, and range objects.\\nAdditional sequence types tailored for processing of\\nbinary data and text strings are\\ndescribed in dedicated sections.\\n\\nCommon Sequence Operations¶\\n\\nThe operations in the following table are supported by most sequence types,\\nboth mutable and immutable. The collections.abc.Sequence ABC is\\nprovided to make it easier to correctly implement these operations on\\ncustom sequence types.\\n\\nThe in and not in operations have the same priorities as the\\ncomparison operations. The + (concatenation) and * (repetition)\\noperations have the same priority as the corresponding numeric operations. 3\\n\\nOperation\\n\\nResult\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nx in s\\n\\nTrue if an item of s is\\nequal to x, else False\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nx not in s\\n\\nFalse if an item of s is\\nequal to x, else True\\n\\n(1)\\n\\ns + t\\n\\nthe concatenation of s and\\nt\\n\\n(6)(7)\\n\\ns * n or\\nn * s\\n\\nequivalent to adding s to\\nitself n times\\n\\n(2)(7)\\n\\ns[i]\\n\\nith item of s, origin 0\\n\\n(3)\\n\\ns[i:j]\\n\\nslice of s from i to j\\n\\n(3)(4)\\n\\ns[i:j:k]\\n\\nslice of s from i to j\\nwith step k\\n\\n(3)(5)\\n\\nlen(s)\\n\\nlength of s\\n\\nmin(s)\\n\\nsmallest item of s\\n\\nmax(s)\\n\\nlargest item of s\\n\\ns.index(x[, i[, j]])\\n\\nindex of the first occurrence\\nof x in s (at or after\\nindex i and before index j)\\n\\n(8)\\n\\ns.count(x)\\n\\ntotal number of occurrences of\\nx in s\\n\\nSequences of the same type also support comparisons.  In particular, tuples\\nand lists are compared lexicographically by comparing corresponding elements.\\nThis means that to compare equal, every element must compare equal and the\\ntwo sequences must be of the same type and have the same length.  (For full\\ndetails see Comparisons in the language reference.)\\n\\nForward and reversed iterators over mutable sequences access values using an\\nindex.  That index will continue to march forward (or backward) even if the\\nunderlying sequence is mutated.  The iterator terminates only when an\\nIndexError or a StopIteration is encountered (or when the index\\ndrops below zero).\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\nWhile the in and not in operations are used only for simple\\ncontainment testing in the general case, some specialised sequences\\n(such as str, bytes and bytearray) also use\\nthem for subsequence testing:\\n>>>>>> \"gg\" in \"eggs\"\\nTrue\\n\\nValues of n less than 0 are treated as 0 (which yields an empty\\nsequence of the same type as s).  Note that items in the sequence s\\nare not copied; they are referenced multiple times.  This often haunts\\nnew Python programmers; consider:\\n>>>>>> lists = [[]] * 3\\n>>> lists\\n[[], [], []]\\n>>> lists[0].append(3)\\n>>> lists\\n[[3], [3], [3]]\\n\\n\\nWhat has happened is that [[]] is a one-element list containing an empty\\nlist, so all three elements of [[]] * 3 are references to this single empty\\nlist.  Modifying any of the elements of lists modifies this single list.\\nYou can create a list of different lists this way:\\n>>>>>> lists = [[] for i in range(3)]\\n>>> lists[0].append(3)\\n>>> lists[1].append(5)\\n>>> lists[2].append(7)\\n>>> lists\\n[[3], [5], [7]]\\n\\n\\nFurther explanation is available in the FAQ entry\\nHow do I create a multidimensional list?.\\n\\nIf i or j is negative, the index is relative to the end of sequence s:\\nlen(s) + i or len(s) + j is substituted.  But note that -0 is\\nstill 0.\\n\\nThe slice of s from i to j is defined as the sequence of items with index\\nk such that i <= k < j.  If i or j is greater than len(s), use\\nlen(s).  If i is omitted or None, use 0.  If j is omitted or\\nNone, use len(s).  If i is greater than or equal to j, the slice is\\nempty.\\n\\nThe slice of s from i to j with step k is defined as the sequence of\\nitems with index  x = i + n*k such that 0 <= n < (j-i)/k.  In other words,\\nthe indices are i, i+k, i+2*k, i+3*k and so on, stopping when\\nj is reached (but never including j).  When k is positive,\\ni and j are reduced to len(s) if they are greater.\\nWhen k is negative, i and j are reduced to len(s) - 1 if\\nthey are greater.  If i or j are omitted or None, they become\\n“end” values (which end depends on the sign of k).  Note, k cannot be zero.\\nIf k is None, it is treated like 1.\\n\\nConcatenating immutable sequences always results in a new object.  This\\nmeans that building up a sequence by repeated concatenation will have a\\nquadratic runtime cost in the total sequence length.  To get a linear\\nruntime cost, you must switch to one of the alternatives below:\\n\\nif concatenating str objects, you can build a list and use\\nstr.join() at the end or else write to an io.StringIO\\ninstance and retrieve its value when complete\\nif concatenating bytes objects, you can similarly use\\nbytes.join() or io.BytesIO, or you can do in-place\\nconcatenation with a bytearray object.  bytearray\\nobjects are mutable and have an efficient overallocation mechanism\\nif concatenating tuple objects, extend a list instead\\nfor other types, investigate the relevant class documentation\\n\\nSome sequence types (such as range) only support item sequences\\nthat follow specific patterns, and hence don’t support sequence\\nconcatenation or repetition.\\n\\nindex raises ValueError when x is not found in s.\\nNot all implementations support passing the additional arguments i and j.\\nThese arguments allow efficient searching of subsections of the sequence. Passing\\nthe extra arguments is roughly equivalent to using s[i:j].index(x), only\\nwithout copying any data and with the returned index being relative to\\nthe start of the sequence rather than the start of the slice.\\n\\nImmutable Sequence Types¶\\n\\nThe only operation that immutable sequence types generally implement that is\\nnot also implemented by mutable sequence types is support for the hash()\\nbuilt-in.\\n\\nThis support allows immutable sequences, such as tuple instances, to\\nbe used as dict keys and stored in set and frozenset\\ninstances.\\n\\nAttempting to hash an immutable sequence that contains unhashable values will\\nresult in TypeError.\\n\\nMutable Sequence Types¶\\n\\nThe operations in the following table are defined on mutable sequence types.\\nThe collections.abc.MutableSequence ABC is provided to make it\\neasier to correctly implement these operations on custom sequence types.\\n\\nbytearray only\\naccepts integers that meet the value restriction\\n\\n<=\\n\\n<=\\n\\n255\\n\\nOperation\\n\\nResult\\n\\nNotes\\n\\ns[i] = x\\n\\nitem i of s is replaced by\\nx\\n\\ns[i:j] = t\\n\\nslice of s from i to j\\nis replaced by the contents of\\nthe iterable t\\n\\ndel s[i:j]\\n\\nsame as s[i:j] = []\\n\\ns[i:j:k] = t\\n\\nthe elements of s[i:j:k]\\nare replaced by those of t\\n\\n(1)\\n\\ndel s[i:j:k]\\n\\nremoves the elements of\\ns[i:j:k] from the list\\n\\ns.append(x)\\n\\nappends x to the end of the\\nsequence (same as\\ns[len(s):len(s)] = [x])\\n\\ns.clear()\\n\\nremoves all items from s\\n(same as del s[:])\\n\\n(5)\\n\\ns.copy()\\n\\ncreates a shallow copy of s\\n(same as s[:])\\n\\n(5)\\n\\ns.extend(t) or\\ns += t\\n\\nextends s with the\\ncontents of t (for the\\nmost part the same as\\ns[len(s):len(s)] = t)\\n\\ns *= n\\n\\nupdates s with its contents\\nrepeated n times\\n\\n(6)\\n\\ns.insert(i, x)\\n\\ninserts x into s at the\\nindex given by i\\n(same as s[i:i] = [x])\\n\\ns.pop() or s.pop(i)\\n\\nretrieves the item at i and\\nalso removes it from s\\n\\n(2)\\n\\ns.remove(x)\\n\\nremove the first item from s\\nwhere s[i] is equal to x\\n\\n(3)\\n\\ns.reverse()\\n\\nreverses the items of s in\\nplace\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\nt must have the same length as the slice it is replacing.\\n\\nThe optional argument i defaults to -1, so that by default the last\\nitem is removed and returned.\\n\\nremove() raises ValueError when x is not found in s.\\n\\nThe reverse() method modifies the sequence in place for economy of\\nspace when reversing a large sequence.  To remind users that it operates by\\nside effect, it does not return the reversed sequence.\\n\\nclear() and copy() are included for consistency with the\\ninterfaces of mutable containers that don’t support slicing operations\\n(such as dict and set). copy() is not part of the\\ncollections.abc.MutableSequence ABC, but most concrete\\nmutable sequence classes provide it.\\n\\nNew in version 3.3: clear() and copy() methods.\\n\\nThe value n is an integer, or an object implementing\\n__index__().  Zero and negative values of n clear\\nthe sequence.  Items in the sequence are not copied; they are referenced\\nmultiple times, as explained for s * n under Common Sequence Operations.\\n\\nLists¶\\n\\nLists are mutable sequences, typically used to store collections of\\nhomogeneous items (where the precise degree of similarity will vary by\\napplication).\\n\\nclass\\n\\nlist\\n\\niterable\\n\\nLists may be constructed in several ways:\\n\\nUsing a pair of square brackets to denote the empty list: []\\nUsing square brackets, separating items with commas: [a], [a, b, c]\\nUsing a list comprehension: [x for x in iterable]\\nUsing the type constructor: list() or list(iterable)\\n\\nThe constructor builds a list whose items are the same and in the same\\norder as iterable’s items.  iterable may be either a sequence, a\\ncontainer that supports iteration, or an iterator object.  If iterable\\nis already a list, a copy is made and returned, similar to iterable[:].\\nFor example, list(\\'abc\\') returns [\\'a\\', \\'b\\', \\'c\\'] and\\nlist( (1, 2, 3) ) returns [1, 2, 3].\\nIf no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty list, [].\\nMany other operations also produce lists, including the sorted()\\nbuilt-in.\\nLists implement all of the common and\\nmutable sequence operations. Lists also provide the\\nfollowing additional method:\\n\\n\\nsort(*, key=None, reverse=False)¶\\nThis method sorts the list in place, using only < comparisons\\nbetween items. Exceptions are not suppressed - if any comparison operations\\nfail, the entire sort operation will fail (and the list will likely be left\\nin a partially modified state).\\nsort() accepts two arguments that can only be passed by keyword\\n(keyword-only arguments):\\nkey specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a\\ncomparison key from each list element (for example, key=str.lower).\\nThe key corresponding to each item in the list is calculated once and\\nthen used for the entire sorting process. The default value of None\\nmeans that list items are sorted directly without calculating a separate\\nkey value.\\nThe functools.cmp_to_key() utility is available to convert a 2.x\\nstyle cmp function to a key function.\\nreverse is a boolean value.  If set to True, then the list elements\\nare sorted as if each comparison were reversed.\\nThis method modifies the sequence in place for economy of space when\\nsorting a large sequence.  To remind users that it operates by side\\neffect, it does not return the sorted sequence (use sorted() to\\nexplicitly request a new sorted list instance).\\nThe sort() method is guaranteed to be stable.  A sort is stable if it\\nguarantees not to change the relative order of elements that compare equal\\n— this is helpful for sorting in multiple passes (for example, sort by\\ndepartment, then by salary grade).\\nFor sorting examples and a brief sorting tutorial, see Sorting HOW TO.\\n\\nCPython implementation detail: While a list is being sorted, the effect of attempting to mutate, or even\\ninspect, the list is undefined.  The C implementation of Python makes the\\nlist appear empty for the duration, and raises ValueError if it can\\ndetect that the list has been mutated during a sort.\\n\\nTuples¶\\n\\nTuples are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of\\nheterogeneous data (such as the 2-tuples produced by the enumerate()\\nbuilt-in). Tuples are also used for cases where an immutable sequence of\\nhomogeneous data is needed (such as allowing storage in a set or\\ndict instance).\\n\\nclass\\n\\ntuple\\n\\niterable\\n\\nTuples may be constructed in a number of ways:\\n\\nUsing a pair of parentheses to denote the empty tuple: ()\\nUsing a trailing comma for a singleton tuple: a, or (a,)\\nSeparating items with commas: a, b, c or (a, b, c)\\nUsing the tuple() built-in: tuple() or tuple(iterable)\\n\\nThe constructor builds a tuple whose items are the same and in the same\\norder as iterable’s items.  iterable may be either a sequence, a\\ncontainer that supports iteration, or an iterator object.  If iterable\\nis already a tuple, it is returned unchanged. For example,\\ntuple(\\'abc\\') returns (\\'a\\', \\'b\\', \\'c\\') and\\ntuple( [1, 2, 3] ) returns (1, 2, 3).\\nIf no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty tuple, ().\\nNote that it is actually the comma which makes a tuple, not the parentheses.\\nThe parentheses are optional, except in the empty tuple case, or\\nwhen they are needed to avoid syntactic ambiguity. For example,\\nf(a, b, c) is a function call with three arguments, while\\nf((a, b, c)) is a function call with a 3-tuple as the sole argument.\\nTuples implement all of the common sequence\\noperations.\\n\\nFor heterogeneous collections of data where access by name is clearer than\\naccess by index, collections.namedtuple() may be a more appropriate\\nchoice than a simple tuple object.\\n\\nRanges¶\\n\\nThe range type represents an immutable sequence of numbers and is\\ncommonly used for looping a specific number of times in for\\nloops.\\n\\nclass\\n\\nrange\\n\\nstop\\n\\nclass\\n\\nrange\\n\\nstart\\n\\nstop\\n\\n[,\\n\\nstep\\n\\nThe arguments to the range constructor must be integers (either built-in\\nint or any object that implements the __index__() special\\nmethod).  If the step argument is omitted, it defaults to 1.\\nIf the start argument is omitted, it defaults to 0.\\nIf step is zero, ValueError is raised.\\nFor a positive step, the contents of a range r are determined by the\\nformula r[i] = start + step*i where i >= 0 and\\nr[i] < stop.\\nFor a negative step, the contents of the range are still determined by\\nthe formula r[i] = start + step*i, but the constraints are i >= 0\\nand r[i] > stop.\\nA range object will be empty if r[0] does not meet the value\\nconstraint.

String literals are\\nwritten in a variety of ways:\\n\\nSingle quotes: \\'allows embedded \"double\" quotes\\'\\n\\nDouble quotes: \"allows embedded \\'single\\' quotes\"\\n\\nTriple quoted: \\'\\'\\'Three single quotes\\'\\'\\', \"\"\"Three double quotes\"\"\"\\n\\nTriple quoted strings may span multiple lines - all associated whitespace will\\nbe included in the string literal.\\n\\nString literals that are part of a single expression and have only whitespace\\nbetween them will be implicitly converted to a single string literal. That\\nis, (\"spam \" \"eggs\") == \"spam eggs\".\\n\\nSee String and Bytes literals for more about the various forms of string literal,\\nincluding supported escape sequences, and the r (“raw”) prefix that\\ndisables most escape sequence processing.\\n\\nStrings may also be created from other objects using the str\\nconstructor.\\n\\nSince there is no separate “character” type, indexing a string produces\\nstrings of length 1. That is, for a non-empty string s, s[0] == s[0:1].\\n\\nThere is also no mutable string type, but str.join() or\\nio.StringIO can be used to efficiently construct strings from\\nmultiple fragments.\\n\\nChanged in version 3.3: For backwards compatibility with the Python 2 series, the u prefix is\\nonce again permitted on string literals.

If object is not\\nprovided, returns the empty string.  Otherwise, the behavior of str()\\ndepends on whether encoding or errors is given, as follows.\\nIf neither encoding nor errors is given, str(object) returns\\ntype(object).__str__(object),\\nwhich is the “informal” or nicely\\nprintable string representation of object.  For string objects, this is\\nthe string itself.  If object does not have a __str__()\\nmethod, then str() falls back to returning\\nrepr(object).\\nIf at least one of encoding or errors is given, object should be a\\nbytes-like object (e.g. bytes or bytearray).  In\\nthis case, if object is a bytes (or bytearray) object,\\nthen str(bytes, encoding, errors) is equivalent to\\nbytes.decode(encoding, errors).  Otherwise, the bytes\\nobject underlying the buffer object is obtained before calling\\nbytes.decode().  See Binary Sequence Types — bytes, bytearray, memoryview and\\nBuffer Protocol for information on buffer objects.\\nPassing a bytes object to str() without the encoding\\nor errors arguments falls under the first case of returning the informal\\nstring representation (see also the -b command-line option to\\nPython).

In addition, see the Text Processing Services section.\\n\\nString Methods¶\\n\\nStrings implement all of the common sequence\\noperations, along with the additional methods described below.\\n\\nStrings also support two styles of string formatting, one providing a large\\ndegree of flexibility and customization (see str.format(),\\nFormat String Syntax and Custom String Formatting) and the other based on C\\nprintf style formatting that handles a narrower range of types and is\\nslightly harder to use correctly, but is often faster for the cases it can\\nhandle (printf-style String Formatting).\\n\\nThe Text Processing Services section of the standard library covers a number of\\nother modules that provide various text related utilities (including regular\\nexpression support in the re module).\\n\\nstr.\\n\\ncapitalize\\n\\nReturn a copy of the string with its first character capitalized and the\\nrest lowercased.\\n\\nChanged in version 3.8: The first character is now put into titlecase rather than uppercase.\\nThis means that characters like digraphs will only have their first\\nletter capitalized, instead of the full character.\\n\\nstr.\\n\\ncasefold\\n\\nReturn a casefolded copy of the string. Casefolded strings may be used for\\ncaseless matching.\\nCasefolding is similar to lowercasing but more aggressive because it is\\nintended to remove all case distinctions in a string. For example, the German\\nlowercase letter \\'ß\\' is equivalent to \"ss\". Since it is already\\nlowercase, lower() would do nothing to \\'ß\\'; casefold()\\nconverts it to \"ss\".\\nThe casefolding algorithm is described in section 3.13 of the Unicode\\nStandard.\\n\\nNew in version 3.3.\\n\\nstr.\\n\\ncenter\\n\\nwidth\\n\\n[,\\n\\nfillchar\\n\\nReturn centered in a string of length width.

With optional\\nstart, test beginning at that position.  With optional end, stop comparing\\nat that position.\\n\\nstr.\\n\\nexpandtabs\\n\\ntabsize\\n\\nReturn a copy of the string where all tab characters are replaced by one or\\nmore spaces, depending on the current column and the given tab size.  Tab\\npositions occur every tabsize characters (default is 8, giving tab\\npositions at columns 0, 8, 16 and so on).  To expand the string, the current\\ncolumn is set to zero and the string is examined character by character.  If\\nthe character is a tab (\\\\t), one or more space characters are inserted\\nin the result until the current column is equal to the next tab position.\\n(The tab character itself is not copied.)  If the character is a newline\\n(\\\\n) or return (\\\\r), it is copied and the current column is reset to\\nzero.  Any other character is copied unchanged and the current column is\\nincremented by one regardless of how the character is represented when\\nprinted.\\n>>>>>> \\'01\\\\t012\\\\t0123\\\\t01234\\'.expandtabs()\\n\\'01      012     0123    01234\\'\\n>>> \\'01\\\\t012\\\\t0123\\\\t01234\\'.expandtabs(4)\\n\\'01  012 0123    01234\\'\\n\\nstr.\\n\\nfind\\n\\nsub\\n\\n[,\\n\\nstart\\n\\n[,\\n\\nend\\n\\nReturn the lowest index in the string where substring sub is found within\\nthe slice s[start:end].  Optional arguments start and end are\\ninterpreted as in slice notation.  Return -1 if sub is not found.\\n\\nNote\\nThe find() method should be used only if you need to know the\\nposition of sub.

The string on which this method is\\ncalled can contain literal text or replacement fields delimited by braces\\n{}.  Each replacement field contains either the numeric index of a\\npositional argument, or the name of a keyword argument.

A character c is alphanumeric if one\\nof the following returns True: c.isalpha(), c.isdecimal(),\\nc.isdigit(), or c.isnumeric().\\n\\nstr.\\n\\nisalpha\\n\\nReturn True if all characters in the string are alphabetic and there is at least\\none character, False otherwise.  Alphabetic characters are those characters defined\\nin the Unicode character database as “Letter”, i.e., those with general category\\nproperty being one of “Lm”, “Lt”, “Lu”, “Ll”, or “Lo”.  Note that this is different\\nfrom the “Alphabetic” property defined in the Unicode Standard.\\n\\nstr.\\n\\nisascii\\n\\nReturn True if the string is empty or all characters in the string are ASCII,\\nFalse otherwise.\\nASCII characters have code points in the range U+0000-U+007F.\\n\\nNew in version 3.7.\\n\\nstr.\\n\\nisdecimal\\n\\nReturn True if all characters in the string are decimal\\ncharacters and there is at least one character, False\\notherwise. Decimal characters are those that can be used to form\\nnumbers in base 10, e.g. U+0660, ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT\\nZERO.  Formally a decimal character is a character in the Unicode\\nGeneral Category “Nd”.\\n\\nstr.\\n\\nisdigit\\n\\nReturn True if all characters in the string are digits and there is at least one\\ncharacter, False otherwise.  Digits include decimal characters and digits that need\\nspecial handling, such as the compatibility superscript digits.\\nThis covers digits which cannot be used to form numbers in base 10,\\nlike the Kharosthi numbers.  Formally, a digit is a character that has the\\nproperty value Numeric_Type=Digit or Numeric_Type=Decimal.\\n\\nstr.\\n\\nisidentifier\\n\\nReturn True if the string is a valid identifier according to the language\\ndefinition, section Identifiers and keywords.\\nCall keyword.iskeyword() to test whether string s is a reserved\\nidentifier, such as def and class.\\nExample:\\n>>>>>> from keyword import iskeyword\\n\\n>>> \\'hello\\'.isidentifier(), iskeyword(\\'hello\\')\\n(True, False)\\n>>> \\'def\\'.isidentifier(), iskeyword(\\'def\\')\\n(True, True)\\n\\nstr.\\n\\nislower\\n\\nReturn True if all cased characters 4 in the string are lowercase and\\nthere is at least one cased character, False otherwise.\\n\\nstr.\\n\\nisnumeric\\n\\nReturn True if all characters in the string are numeric\\ncharacters, and there is at least one character, False\\notherwise.

Nonprintable characters are those characters defined\\nin the Unicode character database as “Other” or “Separator”, excepting the\\nASCII space (0x20) which is considered printable.  (Note that printable\\ncharacters in this context are those which should not be escaped when\\nrepr() is invoked on a string.  It has no bearing on the handling of\\nstrings written to sys.stdout or sys.stderr.)\\n\\nstr.\\n\\nisspace\\n\\nReturn True if there are only whitespace characters in the string and there is\\nat least one character, False otherwise.\\nA character is whitespace if in the Unicode character database\\n(see unicodedata), either its general category is Zs\\n(“Separator, space”), or its bidirectional class is one of WS,\\nB, or S.\\n\\nstr.\\n\\nistitle\\n\\nReturn True if the string is a titlecased string and there is at least one\\ncharacter, for example uppercase characters may only follow uncased characters\\nand lowercase characters only cased ones.

If specified as an \\'*\\' (asterisk), the\\nactual width is read from the next element of the tuple in values, and the\\nobject to convert comes after the minimum field width and optional precision.\\n\\nPrecision (optional), given as a \\'.\\' (dot) followed by the precision.

The mapping key\\nselects the value to be formatted from the mapping.  For example:\\n\\n>>>\\n\\n>>>\\n\\nprint\\n\\n%(language)s\\n\\nhas\\n\\n%(number)03d\\n\\nquote types.\\'\\n\\n...\\n\\n\\'language\\'\\n\\n\"Python\"\\n\\n\"number\"\\n\\n})\\n\\nPython has 002 quote types.\\n\\nIn this case no * specifiers may occur in a format (since they require a\\nsequential parameter list).\\n\\nThe conversion flag characters are:\\n\\nFlag\\n\\nMeaning\\n\\n\\'#\\'\\n\\nThe value conversion will use the “alternate form” (where defined\\nbelow).\\n\\n\\'0\\'\\n\\nThe conversion will be zero padded for numeric values.\\n\\n\\'-\\'\\n\\nThe converted value is left adjusted (overrides the \\'0\\'\\nconversion if both are given).\\n\\n\\' \\'\\n\\n(a space) A blank should be left before a positive number (or empty\\nstring) produced by a signed conversion.\\n\\n\\'+\\'\\n\\nA sign character (\\'+\\' or \\'-\\') will precede the conversion\\n(overrides a “space” flag).\\n\\nA length modifier (h, l, or L) may be present, but is ignored as it\\nis not necessary for Python – so e.g. %ld is identical to %d.\\n\\nThe conversion types are:\\n\\nConversion\\n\\nMeaning\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n\\'d\\'\\n\\nSigned integer decimal.\\n\\n\\'i\\'\\n\\nSigned integer decimal.\\n\\n\\'o\\'\\n\\nSigned octal value.\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n\\'u\\'\\n\\nObsolete type – it is identical to \\'d\\'.\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n\\'x\\'\\n\\nSigned hexadecimal (lowercase).\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n\\'X\\'\\n\\nSigned hexadecimal (uppercase).\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n\\'e\\'\\n\\nFloating point exponential format (lowercase).\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n\\'E\\'\\n\\nFloating point exponential format (uppercase).\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n\\'f\\'\\n\\nFloating point decimal format.\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n\\'F\\'\\n\\nFloating point decimal format.\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n\\'g\\'\\n\\nFloating point format.

They are supported by memoryview which uses\\nthe buffer protocol to access the memory of other\\nbinary objects without needing to make a copy.\\n\\nThe array module supports efficient storage of basic data types like\\n32-bit integers and IEEE754 double-precision floating values.\\n\\nBytes Objects¶\\n\\nBytes objects are immutable sequences of single bytes. Since many major\\nbinary protocols are based on the ASCII text encoding, bytes objects offer\\nseveral methods that are only valid when working with ASCII compatible\\ndata and are closely related to string objects in a variety of other ways.\\n\\nclass\\n\\nbytes\\n\\nsource\\n\\n[,\\n\\nencoding\\n\\n[,\\n\\nerrors\\n\\nFirstly, the syntax for bytes literals is largely the same as that for string\\nliterals, except that a b prefix is added:\\n\\nSingle quotes: b\\'still allows embedded \"double\" quotes\\'\\nDouble quotes: b\"still allows embedded \\'single\\' quotes\"\\nTriple quoted: b\\'\\'\\'3 single quotes\\'\\'\\', b\"\"\"3 double quotes\"\"\"\\n\\nOnly ASCII characters are permitted in bytes literals (regardless of the\\ndeclared source code encoding). Any binary values over 127 must be entered\\ninto bytes literals using the appropriate escape sequence.\\nAs with string literals, bytes literals may also use a r prefix to disable\\nprocessing of escape sequences. See String and Bytes literals for more about the various\\nforms of bytes literal, including supported escape sequences.\\nWhile bytes literals and representations are based on ASCII text, bytes\\nobjects actually behave like immutable sequences of integers, with each\\nvalue in the sequence restricted such that 0 <= x < 256 (attempts to\\nviolate this restriction will trigger ValueError). This is done\\ndeliberately to emphasise that while many binary formats include ASCII based\\nelements and can be usefully manipulated with some text-oriented algorithms,\\nthis is not generally the case for arbitrary binary data (blindly applying\\ntext processing algorithms to binary data formats that are not ASCII\\ncompatible will usually lead to data corruption).\\nIn addition to the literal forms, bytes objects can be created in a number of\\nother ways:\\n\\nA zero-filled bytes object of a specified length: bytes(10)\\nFrom an iterable of integers: bytes(range(20))\\nCopying existing binary data via the buffer protocol:  bytes(obj)\\n\\nAlso see the bytes built-in.\\nSince 2 hexadecimal digits correspond precisely to a single byte, hexadecimal\\nnumbers are a commonly used format for describing binary data.

(This contrasts with text strings, where both indexing\\nand slicing will produce a string of length 1)\\n\\nThe representation of bytes objects uses the literal format (b\\'...\\')\\nsince it is often more useful than e.g. bytes([46, 46, 46]).

You can always convert a bytearray object into\\na list of integers using list(b).\\n\\nBytes and Bytearray Operations¶\\n\\nBoth bytes and bytearray objects support the common\\nsequence operations. They interoperate not just with operands of the same\\ntype, but with any bytes-like object. Due to this flexibility, they can be\\nfreely mixed in operations without causing errors. However, the return type\\nof the result may depend on the order of operands.\\n\\nNote\\n\\nThe methods on bytes and bytearray objects don’t accept strings as their\\narguments, just as the methods on strings don’t accept bytes as their\\narguments.  For example, you have to write:\\n\\n\"abc\"\\n\\nreplace\\n\\n\"a\"\\n\\n\"f\"\\n\\nand:\\n\\n\"abc\"\\n\\nreplace\\n\\n\"a\"\\n\\n\"f\"\\n\\nSome bytes and bytearray operations assume the use of ASCII compatible\\nbinary formats, and hence should be avoided when working with arbitrary\\nbinary data. These restrictions are covered below.\\n\\nNote\\n\\nUsing these ASCII based operations to manipulate binary data that is not\\nstored in an ASCII based format may lead to data corruption.\\n\\nThe following methods on bytes and bytearray objects can be used with\\narbitrary binary data.\\n\\nbytes.\\n\\ncount\\n\\nsub\\n\\n[,\\n\\nstart\\n\\n[,\\n\\nend\\n\\nbytearray.\\n\\ncount\\n\\nsub\\n\\n[,\\n\\nstart\\n\\n[,\\n\\nend\\n\\nReturn the number of non-overlapping occurrences of subsequence sub in\\nthe range [start, end].

If specified as an \\'*\\' (asterisk), the\\nactual width is read from the next element of the tuple in values, and the\\nobject to convert comes after the minimum field width and optional precision.\\n\\nPrecision (optional), given as a \\'.\\' (dot) followed by the precision.

Zero-dimensional memoryviews can be indexed\\nwith the empty tuple.\\nHere is an example with a non-byte format:\\n>>>>>> import array\\n>>> a = array.array(\\'l\\', [-11111111, 22222222, -33333333, 44444444])\\n>>> m = memoryview(a)\\n>>> m[0]\\n-11111111\\n>>> m[-1]\\n44444444\\n>>> m[::2].tolist()\\n[-11111111, -33333333]\\n\\n\\nIf the underlying object is writable, the memoryview supports\\none-dimensional slice assignment.

When order is ‘C’ or ‘F’, the data\\nof the original array is converted to C or Fortran order. For contiguous\\nviews, ‘A’ returns an exact copy of the physical memory.

The return value is a new memoryview, but\\nthe buffer itself is not copied. Supported casts are 1D -> C-contiguous\\nand C-contiguous -> 1D.\\nThe destination format is restricted to a single element native format in\\nstruct syntax.

Being an unordered collection, sets do not record element position or\\norder of insertion.  Accordingly, sets do not support indexing, slicing, or\\nother sequence-like behavior.\\n\\nset and\\n\\nfrozenset.\\nThe\\n\\nset type is mutable — the contents can be changed using methods\\nlike\\n\\nadd()\\n\\nremove()\\n\\nfrozenset type is immutable and\\n\\nhashable —\\nits contents cannot be altered after it is created; it can therefore be used as\\na dictionary key or as an element of another set.\\n\\nNon-empty sets (not frozensets) can be created by placing a comma-separated list\\nof elements within braces, for example: {\\'jack\\', \\'sjoerd\\'}, in addition to the\\nset constructor.\\n\\nThe constructors for both classes work the same:\\n\\nclass\\n\\nset\\n\\niterable\\n\\nclass\\n\\nfrozenset\\n\\niterable\\n\\nReturn a new set or frozenset object whose elements are taken from\\niterable.  The elements of a set must be hashable.  To\\nrepresent sets of sets, the inner sets must be frozenset\\nobjects.  If iterable is not specified, a new empty set is\\nreturned.\\nSets can be created by several means:\\n\\nUse a comma-separated list of elements within braces: {\\'jack\\', \\'sjoerd\\'}\\nUse a set comprehension: {c for c in \\'abracadabra\\' if c not in \\'abc\\'}\\nUse the type constructor: set(), set(\\'foobar\\'), set([\\'a\\', \\'b\\', \\'foo\\'])\\n\\nInstances of set and frozenset provide the following\\noperations:\\n\\n\\nlen(s)\\nReturn the number of elements in set s (cardinality of s).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nx in s\\nTest x for membership in s.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nx not in s\\nTest x for non-membership in s.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nisdisjoint(other)¶\\nReturn True if the set has no elements in common with other.  Sets are\\ndisjoint if and only if their intersection is the empty set.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nissubset(other)¶\\n\\nset <= other\\nTest whether every element in the set is in other.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nset < other\\nTest whether the set is a proper subset of other, that is,\\nset <= other and set != other.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nissuperset(other)¶\\n\\nset >= other\\nTest whether every element in other is in the set.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nset > other\\nTest whether the set is a proper superset of other, that is, set >=\\nother and set != other.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nunion(*others)¶\\n\\nset | other | ...\\nReturn a new set with elements from the set and all others.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nintersection(*others)¶\\n\\nset & other & ...\\nReturn a new set with elements common to the set and all others.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndifference(*others)¶\\n\\nset - other - ...\\nReturn a new set with elements in the set that are not in the others.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsymmetric_difference(other)¶\\n\\nset ^ other\\nReturn a new set with elements in either the set or other but not both.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncopy()¶\\nReturn a shallow copy of the set.\\n\\n\\nNote, the non-operator versions of union(), intersection(),\\ndifference(), symmetric_difference(), issubset(), and\\nissuperset() methods will accept any iterable as an argument.  In\\ncontrast, their operator based counterparts require their arguments to be\\nsets.  This precludes error-prone constructions like set(\\'abc\\') & \\'cbs\\'\\nin favor of the more readable set(\\'abc\\').intersection(\\'cbs\\').\\nBoth set and frozenset support set to set comparisons. Two\\nsets are equal if and only if every element of each set is contained in the\\nother (each is a subset of the other). A set is less than another set if and\\nonly if the first set is a proper subset of the second set (is a subset, but\\nis not equal). A set is greater than another set if and only if the first set\\nis a proper superset of the second set (is a superset, but is not equal).\\nInstances of set are compared to instances of frozenset\\nbased on their members.  For example, set(\\'abc\\') == frozenset(\\'abc\\')\\nreturns True and so does set(\\'abc\\') in set([frozenset(\\'abc\\')]).\\nThe subset and equality comparisons do not generalize to a total ordering\\nfunction.  For example, any two nonempty disjoint sets are not equal and are not\\nsubsets of each other, so all of the following return False: a<b,\\na==b, or a>b.\\nSince sets only define partial ordering (subset relationships), the output of\\nthe list.sort() method is undefined for lists of sets.\\nSet elements, like dictionary keys, must be hashable.\\nBinary operations that mix set instances with frozenset\\nreturn the type of the first operand.  For example: frozenset(\\'ab\\') |\\nset(\\'bc\\') returns an instance of frozenset.\\nThe following table lists operations available for set that do not\\napply to immutable instances of frozenset:\\n\\n\\nupdate(*others)¶\\n\\nset |= other | ...\\nUpdate the set, adding elements from all others.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nintersection_update(*others)¶\\n\\nset &= other & ...\\nUpdate the set, keeping only elements found in it and all others.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndifference_update(*others)¶\\n\\nset -= other | ...\\nUpdate the set, removing elements found in others.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsymmetric_difference_update(other)¶\\n\\nset ^= other\\nUpdate the set, keeping only elements found in either set, but not in both.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nadd(elem)¶\\nAdd element elem to the set.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nremove(elem)¶\\nRemove element elem from the set.  Raises KeyError if elem is\\nnot contained in the set.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndiscard(elem)¶\\nRemove element elem from the set if it is present.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npop()¶\\nRemove and return an arbitrary element from the set.  Raises\\nKeyError if the set is empty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nclear()¶\\nRemove all elements from the set.\\n\\n\\nNote, the non-operator versions of the update(),\\nintersection_update(), difference_update(), and\\nsymmetric_difference_update() methods will accept any iterable as an\\nargument.\\nNote, the elem argument to the __contains__(), remove(), and\\ndiscard() methods may be a set.  To support searching for an equivalent\\nfrozenset, a temporary one is created from elem.\\n\\nMapping Types — dict¶\\n\\nmapping object maps\\n\\nhashable values to arbitrary objects.\\nMappings are mutable objects.  There is currently only one standard mapping\\ntype, the\\n\\nlist,\\n\\nset, and\\n\\ntuple classes, and the\\n\\ncollections module.)\\n\\nA dictionary’s keys are almost arbitrary values.  Values that are not\\nhashable, that is, values containing lists, dictionaries or other\\nmutable types (that are compared by value rather than by object identity) may\\nnot be used as keys.\\nValues that compare equal (such as 1, 1.0, and True)\\ncan be used interchangeably to index the same dictionary entry.\\n\\nclass\\n\\ndict\\n\\n**\\n\\nkwargs\\n\\nclass\\n\\ndict\\n\\nmapping\\n\\n**\\n\\nkwargs\\n\\nclass\\n\\ndict\\n\\niterable\\n\\n**\\n\\nkwargs\\n\\nReturn a new dictionary initialized from an optional positional argument\\nand a possibly empty set of keyword arguments.\\nDictionaries can be created by several means:\\n\\nUse a comma-separated list of key: value pairs within braces:\\n{\\'jack\\': 4098, \\'sjoerd\\': 4127} or {4098: \\'jack\\', 4127: \\'sjoerd\\'}\\nUse a dict comprehension: {}, {x: x ** 2 for x in range(10)}\\nUse the type constructor: dict(),\\ndict([(\\'foo\\', 100), (\\'bar\\', 200)]), dict(foo=100, bar=200)\\n\\nIf no positional argument is given, an empty dictionary is created.\\nIf a positional argument is given and it is a mapping object, a dictionary\\nis created with the same key-value pairs as the mapping object.  Otherwise,\\nthe positional argument must be an iterable object.  Each item in\\nthe iterable must itself be an iterable with exactly two objects.  The\\nfirst object of each item becomes a key in the new dictionary, and the\\nsecond object the corresponding value.  If a key occurs more than once, the\\nlast value for that key becomes the corresponding value in the new\\ndictionary.\\nIf keyword arguments are given, the keyword arguments and their values are\\nadded to the dictionary created from the positional argument.  If a key\\nbeing added is already present, the value from the keyword argument\\nreplaces the value from the positional argument.\\nTo illustrate, the following examples all return a dictionary equal to\\n{\"one\": 1, \"two\": 2, \"three\": 3}:\\n>>>>>> a = dict(one=1, two=2, three=3)\\n>>> b = {\\'one\\': 1, \\'two\\': 2, \\'three\\': 3}\\n>>> c = dict(zip([\\'one\\', \\'two\\', \\'three\\'], [1, 2, 3]))\\n>>> d = dict([(\\'two\\', 2), (\\'one\\', 1), (\\'three\\', 3)])\\n>>> e = dict({\\'three\\': 3, \\'one\\': 1, \\'two\\': 2})\\n>>> f = dict({\\'one\\': 1, \\'three\\': 3}, two=2)\\n>>> a == b == c == d == e == f\\nTrue\\n\\n\\nProviding keyword arguments as in the first example only works for keys that\\nare valid Python identifiers.  Otherwise, any valid keys can be used.\\nThese are the operations that dictionaries support (and therefore, custom\\nmapping types should support too):\\n\\n\\nlist(d)\\nReturn a list of all the keys used in the dictionary d.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlen(d)\\nReturn the number of items in the dictionary d.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nd[key]\\nReturn the item of d with key key.  Raises a KeyError if key is\\nnot in the map.\\nIf a subclass of dict defines a method __missing__() and key\\nis not present, the d[key] operation calls that method with the key key\\nas argument.  The d[key] operation then returns or raises whatever is\\nreturned or raised by the __missing__(key) call.\\nNo other operations or methods invoke __missing__(). If\\n__missing__() is not defined, KeyError is raised.\\n__missing__() must be a method; it cannot be an instance variable:\\n>>>>>> class Counter(dict):\\n...     def __missing__(self, key):\\n...         return 0\\n>>> c = Counter()\\n>>> c[\\'red\\']\\n0\\n>>> c[\\'red\\'] += 1\\n>>> c[\\'red\\']\\n1\\n\\n\\nThe example above shows part of the implementation of\\ncollections.Counter.  A different __missing__ method is used\\nby collections.defaultdict.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nd[key] = value\\nSet d[key] to value.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndel d[key]\\nRemove d[key] from d.  Raises a KeyError if key is not in the\\nmap.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nkey in d\\nReturn True if d has a key key, else False.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nkey not in d\\nEquivalent to not key in d.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\niter(d)\\nReturn an iterator over the keys of the dictionary.

If the dictionary is empty, calling\\npopitem() raises a KeyError.\\n\\nChanged in version 3.7: LIFO order is now guaranteed. In prior versions, popitem() would\\nreturn an arbitrary key/value pair.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nreversed(d)\\nReturn a reverse iterator over the keys of the dictionary.

Return None.\\nupdate() accepts either another dictionary object or an iterable of\\nkey/value pairs (as tuples or other iterables of length two).  If keyword\\narguments are specified, the dictionary is then updated with those\\nkey/value pairs: d.update(red=1, blue=2).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nvalues()¶\\nReturn a new view of the dictionary’s values.  See the\\ndocumentation of view objects.\\nAn equality comparison between one dict.values() view and another\\nwill always return False.

This is implemented using a pair of methods\\nthat allow user-defined classes to define a runtime context that is entered\\nbefore the statement body is executed and exited when the statement ends:\\n\\ncontextmanager.\\n\\n__enter__\\n\\nEnter the runtime context and return either this object or another object\\nrelated to the runtime context. The value returned by this method is bound to\\nthe identifier in the as clause of with statements using\\nthis context manager.\\nAn example of a context manager that returns itself is a file object.\\nFile objects return themselves from __enter__() to allow open() to be\\nused as the context expression in a with statement.\\nAn example of a context manager that returns a related object is the one\\nreturned by decimal.localcontext(). These managers set the active\\ndecimal context to a copy of the original decimal context and then return the\\ncopy. This allows changes to be made to the current decimal context in the body\\nof the with statement without affecting code outside the\\nwith statement.\\n\\ncontextmanager.\\n\\n__exit__\\n\\nexc_type\\n\\nexc_val\\n\\nexc_tb\\n\\nExit the runtime context and return a Boolean flag indicating if any exception\\nthat occurred should be suppressed. If an exception occurred while executing the\\nbody of the with statement, the arguments contain the exception type,\\nvalue and traceback information. Otherwise, all three arguments are None.\\nReturning a true value from this method will cause the with statement\\nto suppress the exception and continue execution with the statement immediately\\nfollowing the with statement. Otherwise the exception continues\\npropagating after this method has finished executing. Exceptions that occur\\nduring execution of this method will replace any exception that occurred in the\\nbody of the with statement.\\nThe exception passed in should never be reraised explicitly - instead, this\\nmethod should return a false value to indicate that the method completed\\nsuccessfully and does not want to suppress the raised exception. This allows\\ncontext management code to easily detect whether or not an __exit__()\\nmethod has actually failed.\\n\\nPython defines several context managers to support easy thread synchronisation,\\nprompt closure of files or other objects, and simpler manipulation of the active\\ndecimal arithmetic context. The specific types are not treated specially beyond\\ntheir implementation of the context management protocol. See the\\ncontextlib module for some examples.\\n\\nPython’s generators and the contextlib.contextmanager decorator\\nprovide a convenient way to implement these protocols.  If a generator function is\\ndecorated with the contextlib.contextmanager decorator, it will return a\\ncontext manager implementing the necessary __enter__() and\\n__exit__() methods, rather than the iterator produced by an\\nundecorated generator function.\\n\\nNote that there is no specific slot for any of these methods in the type\\nstructure for Python objects in the Python/C API. Extension types wanting to\\ndefine these methods must provide them as a normal Python accessible method.\\nCompared to the overhead of setting up the runtime context, the overhead of a\\nsingle class dictionary lookup is negligible.\\n\\nType Annotation Types — Generic Alias, Union¶\\n\\nThe core built-in types for type annotations are\\nGeneric Alias and Union.\\n\\nGeneric Alias Type¶\\n\\nGenericAlias\\n\\nsubscripting a class. They are most often used with\\n\\ncontainer classes, such as\\n\\nlist or\\n\\ndict. For example,\\n\\nlist[int]\\n\\nGenericAlias\\n\\nlist\\n\\nint.\\n\\nGenericAlias\\n\\ntype annotations.\\n\\nNote\\n\\nIt is generally only possible to subscript a class if the class implements\\nthe special method __class_getitem__().\\n\\nA GenericAlias object acts as a proxy for a generic type,\\nimplementing parameterized generics.\\n\\nFor a container class, the\\nargument(s) supplied to a subscription of the class may\\nindicate the type(s) of the elements an object contains. For example,\\nset[bytes] can be used in type annotations to signify a set in\\nwhich all the elements are of type bytes.\\n\\nFor a class which defines __class_getitem__() but is not a\\ncontainer, the argument(s) supplied to a subscription of the class will often\\nindicate the return type(s) of one or more methods defined on an object. For\\nexample, regular expressions can be used on both the str data\\ntype and the bytes data type:\\n\\nIf x = re.search(\\'foo\\', \\'foo\\'), x will be a\\nre.Match object where the return values of\\nx.group(0) and x[0] will both be of type str. We can\\nrepresent this kind of object in type annotations with the GenericAlias\\nre.Match[str].\\n\\nIf y = re.search(b\\'bar\\', b\\'bar\\'), (note the b for bytes),\\ny will also be an instance of re.Match, but the return\\nvalues of y.group(0) and y[0] will both be of type\\nbytes. In type annotations, we would represent this\\nvariety of re.Match objects with re.Match[bytes].\\n\\nGenericAlias objects are instances of the class\\ntypes.GenericAlias, which can also be used to create GenericAlias\\nobjects directly.\\n\\nT[X, Y, ...]\\n\\nCreates a GenericAlias representing a type T parameterized by types\\nX, Y, and more depending on the T used.\\nFor example, a function expecting a list containing\\nfloat elements:\\ndef average(values: list[float]) -> float:\\n    return sum(values) / len(values)\\n\\n\\nAnother example for mapping objects, using a dict, which\\nis a generic type expecting two type parameters representing the key type\\nand the value type.  In this example, the function expects a dict with\\nkeys of type str and values of type int:\\ndef send_post_request(url: str, body: dict[str, int]) -> None:\\n    ...\\n\\nThe builtin functions isinstance() and issubclass() do not accept\\nGenericAlias types for their second argument:\\n\\n>>>\\n\\n>>>\\n\\nisinstance\\n\\n([\\n\\n],\\n\\nlist\\n\\nstr\\n\\n])\\n\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n\\nFile\\n\\n\"<stdin>\"\\n\\n, line\\n\\n, in\\n\\n<module>\\n\\nTypeError\\n\\nisinstance() argument 2 cannot be a parameterized generic\\n\\nThe Python runtime does not enforce type annotations.\\nThis extends to generic types and their type parameters.

These types are intended\\nprimarily for type annotations. The union type expression\\nenables cleaner type hinting syntax compared to typing.Union.\\n\\nX | Y | ...\\n\\nDefines a union object which holds types X, Y, and so forth. X | Y\\nmeans either X or Y.  It is equivalent to typing.Union[X, Y].\\nFor example, the following function expects an argument of type\\nint or float:\\ndef square(number: int | float) -> int | float:\\n    return number ** 2\\n\\n\\n\\nNote\\nThe | operand cannot be used at runtime to define unions where one or\\nmore members is a forward reference.

Most of these support\\nonly one or two operations.\\n\\nModules¶\\n\\nm.name\\n\\nimport\\nstatement is not, strictly speaking, an operation on a module object;\\n\\nimport\\n\\nfoo\\n\\n__dict__. This is the\\ndictionary containing the module’s symbol table. Modifying this dictionary will\\nactually change the module’s symbol table, but direct assignment to the\\n\\n__dict__ attribute is not possible (you can write\\n\\nm.__dict__[\\'a\\']\\n\\nm.a\\n\\nm.__dict__\\n\\n{}\\n\\n__dict__ directly is\\nnot recommended.\\n\\nModules built into the interpreter are written like this: <module \\'sys\\'\\n(built-in)>.  If loaded from a file, they are written as <module \\'os\\' from\\n\\'/usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/os.pyc\\'>.\\n\\nClasses and Class Instances¶\\n\\nSee Objects, values and types and Class definitions for these.\\n\\nFunctions¶\\n\\nFunction objects are created by function definitions.  The only operation on a\\nfunction object is to call it: func(argument-list).\\n\\nThere are really two flavors of function objects: built-in functions and\\nuser-defined functions.  Both support the same operation (to call the function),\\nbut the implementation is different, hence the different object types.\\n\\nSee Function definitions for more information.\\n\\nMethods¶\\n\\nMethods are functions that are called using the attribute notation. There are\\ntwo flavors: built-in methods (such as append() on lists) and class\\ninstance methods.  Built-in methods are described with the types that support\\nthem.\\n\\nself\\n\\nm.__self__\\n\\nm.__func__\\n\\nm(arg-1,\\n\\narg-2,\\n\\n...,\\n\\narg-n)\\n\\nm.__func__(m.__self__,\\n\\narg-1,\\n\\narg-2,\\n\\n...,\\n\\narg-n)\\n\\nLike function objects, bound method objects support getting arbitrary\\nattributes.  However, since method attributes are actually stored on the\\nunderlying function object (meth.__func__), setting method attributes on\\nbound methods is disallowed.  Attempting to set an attribute on a method\\nresults in an AttributeError being raised.  In order to set a method\\nattribute, you need to explicitly set it on the underlying function object:\\n\\n>>>\\n\\n>>>\\n\\nclass\\n\\n...\\n\\ndef\\n\\nmethod\\n\\nself\\n\\n):\\n\\n...\\n\\npass\\n\\n...\\n\\n>>>\\n\\n()\\n\\n>>>\\n\\nmethod\\n\\nwhoami\\n\\n\\'my name is method\\'\\n\\n# can\\'t set on the method\\n\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n\\nFile\\n\\n\"<stdin>\"\\n\\n, line\\n\\n, in\\n\\n<module>\\n\\nAttributeError\\n\\n\\'method\\' object has no attribute \\'whoami\\'\\n\\n>>>\\n\\nmethod\\n\\n__func__\\n\\nwhoami\\n\\n\\'my name is method\\'\\n\\n>>>\\n\\nmethod\\n\\nwhoami\\n\\n\\'my name is method\\'\\n\\nSee The standard type hierarchy for more information.\\n\\nCode Objects¶\\n\\nCode objects are used by the implementation to represent “pseudo-compiled”\\nexecutable Python code such as a function body. They differ from function\\nobjects because they don’t contain a reference to their global execution\\nenvironment.  Code objects are returned by the built-in compile() function\\nand can be extracted from function objects through their __code__\\nattribute. See also the code module.\\n\\nAccessing __code__ raises an auditing event\\nobject.__getattr__ with arguments obj and \"__code__\".\\n\\nA code object can be executed or evaluated by passing it (instead of a source\\nstring) to the exec() or eval()  built-in functions.\\n\\nSee The standard type hierarchy for more information.\\n\\nType Objects¶\\n\\nType objects represent the various object types.  An object’s type is accessed\\nby the built-in function type().  There are no special operations on\\ntypes.  The standard module types defines names for all standard built-in\\ntypes.\\n\\nTypes are written like this: <class \\'int\\'>.\\n\\nThe Null Object¶\\n\\nThis object is returned by functions that don’t explicitly return a value.  It\\nsupports no special operations.  There is exactly one null object, named\\nNone (a built-in name).  type(None)() produces the same singleton.\\n\\nIt is written as None.\\n\\nThe Ellipsis Object¶\\n\\nThis object is commonly used by slicing (see Slicings).  It supports no\\nspecial operations.  There is exactly one ellipsis object, named\\nEllipsis (a built-in name).  type(Ellipsis)() produces the\\nEllipsis singleton.\\n\\nIt is written as Ellipsis or ....\\n\\nThe NotImplemented Object¶\\n\\nThis object is returned from comparisons and binary operations when they are\\nasked to operate on types they don’t support. See Comparisons for more\\ninformation.  There is exactly one NotImplemented object.\\ntype(NotImplemented)() produces the singleton instance.\\n\\nIt is written as NotImplemented.\\n\\nBoolean Values¶\\n\\nBoolean values are the two constant objects False and True.  They are\\nused to represent truth values (although other values can also be considered\\nfalse or true).  In numeric contexts (for example when used as the argument to\\nan arithmetic operator), they behave like the integers 0 and 1, respectively.\\nThe built-in function bool() can be used to convert any value to a\\nBoolean, if the value can be interpreted as a truth value (see section\\nTruth Value Testing above).\\n\\nThey are written as False and True, respectively.\\n\\nInternal Objects¶\\n\\nSee The standard type hierarchy for this information.  It describes stack frame objects,\\ntraceback objects, and slice objects.\\n\\nSpecial Attributes¶\\n\\nThe implementation adds a few special read-only attributes to several object\\ntypes, where they are relevant.  Some of these are not reported by the\\ndir() built-in function.\\n\\nobject.\\n\\n__dict__\\n\\nA dictionary or other mapping object used to store an object’s (writable)\\nattributes.\\n\\ninstance.\\n\\n__class__\\n\\nThe class to which a class instance belongs.\\n\\nclass.\\n\\n__bases__\\n\\nThe tuple of base classes of a class object.\\n\\ndefinition.\\n\\n__name__\\n\\nThe name of the class, function, method, descriptor, or\\ngenerator instance.\\n\\ndefinition.\\n\\n__qualname__\\n\\nThe qualified name of the class, function, method, descriptor,\\nor generator instance.\\n\\nNew in version 3.3.\\n\\nclass.\\n\\n__mro__\\n\\nThis attribute is a tuple of classes that are considered when looking for\\nbase classes during method resolution.\\n\\nclass.\\n\\nmro\\n\\nThis method can be overridden by a metaclass to customize the method\\nresolution order for its instances.  It is called at class instantiation, and\\nits result is stored in __mro__.\\n\\nclass.\\n\\n__subclasses__\\n\\nEach class keeps a list of weak references to its immediate subclasses.  This\\nmethod returns a list of all those references still alive.  The list is in\\ndefinition order.  Example:\\n>>>>>> int.__subclasses__()\\n[<class \\'bool\\'>, <enum \\'IntEnum\\'>, <flag \\'IntFlag\\'>, <class \\'re._constants._NamedIntConstant\\'>]\\n\\nInteger string conversion length limitation¶\\n\\nCPython has a global limit for converting between int and str\\nto mitigate denial of service attacks. This limit only applies to decimal or\\nother non-power-of-two number bases. Hexadecimal, octal, and binary conversions\\nare unlimited. The limit can be configured.\\n\\nThe int type in CPython is an arbitrary length number stored in binary\\nform (commonly known as a “bignum”). There exists no algorithm that can convert\\na string to a binary integer or a binary integer to a string in linear time,\\nunless the base is a power of 2. Even the best known algorithms for base 10\\nhave sub-quadratic complexity. Converting a large value such as int(\\'1\\' *\\n500_000) can take over a second on a fast CPU.\\n\\nLimiting conversion size offers a practical way to avoid CVE-2020-10735.\\n\\nThe limit is applied to the number of digit characters in the input or output\\nstring when a non-linear conversion algorithm would be involved.

A value of -1 indicates that both were unset, thus a value of\\nsys.int_info.default_max_str_digits was used during initialization.\\n\\nFrom code, you can inspect the current limit and set a new one using these\\nsys APIs:\\n\\nsys.get_int_max_str_digits() and sys.set_int_max_str_digits() are\\na getter and setter for the interpreter-wide limit. Subinterpreters have\\ntheir own limit.\\n\\nInformation about the default and minimum can be found in sys.int_info:\\n\\nsys.int_info.default_max_str_digits is the compiled-in\\ndefault limit.\\n\\nsys.int_info.str_digits_check_threshold is the lowest\\naccepted value for the limit (other than 0 which disables it).\\n\\nNew in version 3.11.\\n\\nCaution\\n\\nSetting a low limit can lead to problems. While rare, code exists that\\ncontains integer constants in decimal in their source that exceed the\\nminimum threshold. A consequence of setting the limit is that Python source\\ncode containing decimal integer literals longer than the limit will\\nencounter an error during parsing, usually at startup time or import time or\\neven at installation time - anytime an up to date .pyc does not already\\nexist for the code. A workaround for source that contains such large\\nconstants is to convert them to 0x hexadecimal form as it has no limit.\\n\\nTest your application thoroughly if you use a low limit. Ensure your tests\\nrun with the limit set early via the environment or flag so that it applies\\nduring startup and even during any installation step that may invoke Python\\nto precompile .py sources to .pyc files.\\n\\nRecommended configuration¶\\n\\nThe default sys.int_info.default_max_str_digits is expected to be\\nreasonable for most applications. If your application requires a different\\nlimit, set it from your main entry point using Python version agnostic code as\\nthese APIs were added in security patch releases in versions before 3.11.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n>>>\\n\\n>>>\\n\\nimport\\n\\nsys\\n\\n>>>\\n\\nif\\n\\nhasattr\\n\\nsys\\n\\n\"set_int_max_str_digits\"\\n\\n):\\n\\n...\\n\\nupper_bound\\n\\n68000\\n\\n...\\n\\nlower_bound\\n\\n4004\\n\\n...\\n\\ncurrent_limit\\n\\nsys\\n\\nget_int_max_str_digits\\n\\n()\\n\\n...\\n\\nif\\n\\ncurrent_limit\\n\\n==\\n\\nor\\n\\ncurrent_limit\\n\\nupper_bound\\n\\n...\\n\\nsys\\n\\nset_int_max_str_digits\\n\\nupper_bound\\n\\n...\\n\\nelif\\n\\ncurrent_limit\\n\\nlower_bound\\n\\n...\\n\\nsys\\n\\nset_int_max_str_digits\\n\\nlower_bound\\n\\nIf you need to disable it entirely, set it to 0.\\n\\nFootnotes\\n\\nAdditional information on these special methods may be found in the Python\\nReference Manual (Basic customization).\\n\\nAs a consequence, the list [1, 2] is considered equal to [1.0, 2.0], and\\nsimilarly for tuples.\\n\\nThey must have since the parser can’t tell the type of the operands.\\n\\n(1,2,3,4)\\n\\nCased characters are those with general category property being one of\\n“Lu” (Letter, uppercase), “Ll” (Letter, lowercase), or “Lt” (Letter, titlecase).\\n\\n(1,2)\\n\\nTo format only a tuple you should therefore provide a singleton tuple whose only\\nelement is the tuple to be formatted.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nBuilt-in Types\\nTruth Value Testing\\nBoolean Operations — and, or, not\\nComparisons\\nNumeric Types — int, float, complex\\nBitwise Operations on Integer Types\\nAdditional Methods on Integer Types\\nAdditional Methods on Float\\nHashing of numeric types\\n\\n\\nIterator Types\\nGenerator Types\\n\\n\\nSequence Types — list, tuple, range\\nCommon Sequence Operations\\nImmutable Sequence Types\\nMutable Sequence Types\\nLists\\nTuples\\nRanges\\n\\n\\nText Sequence Type — str\\nString Methods\\nprintf-style String Formatting\\n\\n\\nBinary Sequence Types — bytes, bytearray, memoryview\\nBytes Objects\\nBytearray Objects\\nBytes and Bytearray Operations\\nprintf-style Bytes Formatting\\nMemory Views\\n\\n\\nSet Types — set, frozenset\\nMapping Types — dict\\nDictionary view objects\\n\\n\\nContext Manager Types\\nType Annotation Types — Generic Alias, Union\\nGeneric Alias Type\\nStandard Generic Classes\\nSpecial Attributes of GenericAlias objects\\n\\n\\nUnion Type\\n\\n\\nOther Built-in Types\\nModules\\nClasses and Class Instances\\nFunctions\\nMethods\\nCode Objects\\nType Objects\\nThe Null Object\\nThe Ellipsis Object\\nThe NotImplemented Object\\nBoolean Values\\nInternal Objects\\n\\n\\nSpecial Attributes\\nInteger string conversion length limitation\\nAffected APIs\\nConfiguring the limit\\nRecommended configuration\\n\\nPrevious topic\\n\\nBuilt-in Constants\\n\\nNext topic\\n\\nBuilt-in Exceptions\\n\\nThis Page\\n\\nReport a Bug\\n\\nShow Source\\n\\nNavigation\\n\\nindex\\n\\nmodules |\\n\\nnext |\\n\\nprevious |\\n\\n\\n\\nPython »\\n\\nEnglishSpanishFrenchJapaneseKoreanBrazilian PortugueseTurkishSimplified ChineseTraditional Chinese\\n            dev (3.13)pre (3.12)3.11.43.103.93.83.73.63.52.7\\n\\n\\n\\n3.11.4 Documentation »\\n\\nThe Python Standard Library »\\n\\nBuilt-in Types\\n\\n|\\n\\n\\n    © \\n\\nCopyright 2001-2023, Python Software Foundation.\\n\\nHistory and License for more information.\\n\\nPlease donate.\\n\\nFound a bug?\\n\\nSphinx 4.5.0.', metadata={'source': 'http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html'}),\n Document(page_content='لم يتم العثور على الصفحة\\n\\nعفواً، لم نتمكن من العثور على الصفحة التي تبحث عنها. برجاء المحاولة مرة أخرى للصفحة السابقة أو الانتقال لـمركز المساعدة للمزيد من المعلومات\\n\\nالإنتقال لموجزك الرئيسي\\n\\nStránka nenalezena\\n\\nOmlouváme se, nemůžeme najít stránku, kterou hledáte.
